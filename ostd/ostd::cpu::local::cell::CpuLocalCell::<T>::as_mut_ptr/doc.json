  "doc": " Gets access to the underlying value through a raw pointer.\n\n This function calculates the virtual address of the CPU-local object\n based on the CPU-local base address and the offset in the BSP.\n\n This method is safe, but using the returned pointer will be unsafe.\n Specifically,\n - Preemption should be disabled from the time this method is called\n   to the time the pointer is used. Otherwise, the pointer may point\n   to the variable on another CPU, making it difficult or impossible\n   to determine if the data can be borrowed.\n - If the variable can be used in interrupt handlers, borrowing the\n   data should be done with interrupts disabled. Otherwise, more care\n   must be taken to ensure that the borrowing rules are correctly\n   enforced, since the interrupts may come asynchronously.\n"
