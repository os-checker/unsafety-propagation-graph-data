Other than the semantics\n provided by [`Self::find_next`], this method also supports finding non-\n leaf entries and splitting huge pages if necessary.\n\n `find_unmap_subtree` specifies whether the cursor should stop at the\n highest possible level for unmapping. If `false`, the cursor will only\n stop at leaf entries.\n\n `split_huge` specifies whether the cursor should split huge pages when\n it finds a huge page that is mapped over the required range (`len`).\n"
