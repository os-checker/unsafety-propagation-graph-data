  "doc": " Waits until some condition is met.\n\n This method takes a closure that tests a user-given condition.\n The method only returns if the condition returns `Some(_)`.\n A waker thread should first make the condition `Some(_)`, then invoke the\n `wake`-family method. This ordering is important to ensure that waiter\n threads do not lose any wakeup notifications.\n\n By taking a condition closure, this wait-wakeup mechanism becomes\n more efficient and robust.\n"
