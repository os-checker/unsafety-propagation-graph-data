  "doc": " Gets an mutable cursor in the virtual address range.\n\n The same as [`Self::cursor`], the cursor behaves like a lock guard,\n exclusively owning a sub-tree of the page table, preventing others\n from creating a cursor in it. So be sure to drop the cursor as soon as\n possible.\n\n The creation of the cursor may block if another cursor having an\n overlapping range is alive. The modification to the mapping by the\n cursor may also block or be overridden the mapping of another cursor.\n"
