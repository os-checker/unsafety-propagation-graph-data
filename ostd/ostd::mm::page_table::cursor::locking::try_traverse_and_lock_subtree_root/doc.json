  "doc": " Finds and locks an intermediate page table node that covers the range.\n\n If that node (or any of its ancestors) does not exist, we need to lock\n the parent and create it. After the creation the lock of the parent will\n be released and the new node will be locked.\n\n If this function founds that a locked node is stray (because of racing with\n page table recycling), it will return `None`. The caller should retry in\n this case to lock the proper node.\n"
