  "doc": " Returns an immutable reference if no other `RwArc` points to the same allocation.\n\n This method is cheap because it does not acquire a lock.\n\n It's still sound because:\n - The mutable reference to `self` and the condition ensure that we are exclusively\n   accessing the unique `RwArc` instance for the particular allocation.\n - There may be any number of [`RoArc`]s pointing to the same allocation, but they may only\n   produce immutable references to the underlying data.\n"
