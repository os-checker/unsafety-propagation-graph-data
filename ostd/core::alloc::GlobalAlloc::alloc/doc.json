  "doc": " Allocates memory as described by the given `layout`.\n\n Returns a pointer to newly-allocated memory,\n or null to indicate allocation failure.\n\n # Safety\n\n `layout` must have non-zero size. Attempting to allocate for a zero-sized `layout` will\n result in undefined behavior.\n\n (Extension subtraits might provide more specific bounds on\n behavior, e.g., guarantee a sentinel address or a null pointer\n in response to a zero-size allocation request.)\n\n The allocated block of memory may or may not be initialized.\n\n # Errors\n\n Returning a null pointer indicates that either memory is exhausted\n or `layout` does not meet this allocator's size or alignment constraints.\n\n Implementations are encouraged to return null on memory\n exhaustion rather than aborting, but this is not\n a strict requirement. (Specifically: it is *legal* to\n implement this trait atop an underlying native allocation\n library that aborts on memory exhaustion.)\n\n Clients wishing to abort computation in response to an\n allocation error are encouraged to call the [`handle_alloc_error`] function,\n rather than directly invoking `panic!` or similar.\n\n [`handle_alloc_error`]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html\n"
