  "doc": " Maps a range of [`IoMem`] into the current slot.\n\n The memory region to be mapped is the [`IoMem`] range starting at\n `offset` and extending to `offset + len`, or to the end of [`IoMem`],\n whichever comes first. This method will bring the cursor to the next\n slot after the modification.\n\n # Limitations\n\n Once an instance of `IoMem` is mapped to a `VmSpace`,\n then the `IoMem` instance will only be dropped when the `VmSpace` is\n dropped, not when all the mappings backed by the `IoMem` are destroyed\n with the `unmap` method.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `len` or `offset` is not aligned to the page size.\n"
