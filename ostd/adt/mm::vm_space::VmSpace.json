  "doc_adt": " A virtual address space for user-mode tasks, enabling safe manipulation of user-space memory.\n\n The `VmSpace` type provides memory isolation guarantees between user-space and\n kernel-space. For example, given an arbitrary user-space pointer, one can read and\n write the memory location referred to by the user-space pointer without the risk of\n breaking the memory safety of the kernel space.\n\n # Task Association Semantics\n\n As far as OSTD is concerned, a `VmSpace` is not necessarily associated with a task. Once a\n `VmSpace` is activated (see [`VmSpace::activate`]), it remains activated until another\n `VmSpace` is activated **possibly by another task running on the same CPU**.\n\n This means that it's up to the kernel to ensure that a task's `VmSpace` is always activated\n while the task is running. This can be done by using the injected post schedule handler\n (see [`inject_post_schedule_handler`]) to always activate the correct `VmSpace` after each\n context switch.\n\n If the kernel otherwise decides not to ensure that the running task's `VmSpace` is always\n activated, the kernel must deal with race conditions when calling methods that require the\n `VmSpace` to be activated, e.g., [`UserMode::execute`], [`VmSpace::reader`],\n [`VmSpace::writer`]. Otherwise, the behavior is unspecified, though it's guaranteed _not_ to\n compromise the kernel's memory safety.\n\n # Memory Backing\n\n A newly-created `VmSpace` is not backed by any physical memory pages. To\n provide memory pages for a `VmSpace`, one can allocate and map physical\n memory ([`UFrame`]s) to the `VmSpace` using the cursor.\n\n A `VmSpace` can also attach a page fault handler, which will be invoked to\n handle page faults generated from user space.\n\n [`inject_post_schedule_handler`]: crate::task::inject_post_schedule_handler\n [`UserMode::execute`]: crate::user::UserMode::execute\n",
