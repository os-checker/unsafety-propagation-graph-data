  "doc_adt": " A cursor over a `BTreeMap` with editing operations.\n\n A `Cursor` is like an iterator, except that it can freely seek back-and-forth, and can\n safely mutate the map during iteration. This is because the lifetime of its yielded\n references is tied to its own lifetime, instead of just the underlying map. This means\n cursors cannot yield multiple elements at once.\n\n Cursors always point to a gap between two elements in the map, and can\n operate on the two immediately adjacent elements.\n\n A `CursorMut` is created with the [`BTreeMap::lower_bound_mut`] and [`BTreeMap::upper_bound_mut`]\n methods.\n",
