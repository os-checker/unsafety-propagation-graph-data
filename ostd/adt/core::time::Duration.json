  "doc_adt": " A `Duration` type to represent a span of time, typically used for system\n timeouts.\n\n Each `Duration` is composed of a whole number of seconds and a fractional part\n represented in nanoseconds. If the underlying system does not support\n nanosecond-level precision, APIs binding a system timeout will typically round up\n the number of nanoseconds.\n\n [`Duration`]s implement many common traits, including [`Add`], [`Sub`], and other\n [`ops`] traits. It implements [`Default`] by returning a zero-length `Duration`.\n\n [`ops`]: crate::ops\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::time::Duration;\n\n let five_seconds = Duration::new(5, 0);\n let five_seconds_and_five_nanos = five_seconds + Duration::new(0, 5);\n\n assert_eq!(five_seconds_and_five_nanos.as_secs(), 5);\n assert_eq!(five_seconds_and_five_nanos.subsec_nanos(), 5);\n\n let ten_millis = Duration::from_millis(10);\n ```\n\n # Formatting `Duration` values\n\n `Duration` intentionally does not have a `Display` impl, as there are a\n variety of ways to format spans of time for human readability. `Duration`\n provides a `Debug` impl that shows the full precision of the value.\n\n The `Debug` output uses the non-ASCII \"µs\" suffix for microseconds. If your\n program output may appear in contexts that cannot rely on full Unicode\n compatibility, you may wish to format `Duration` objects yourself or use a\n crate to do so.\n",
