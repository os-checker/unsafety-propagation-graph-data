  "doc_adt": " Represents the MADT - this contains the MADT header fields. You can then iterate over a `Madt`\n to read each entry from it.\n\n In modern versions of ACPI, the MADT can detail one of four interrupt models:\n - The ancient dual-i8259 legacy PIC model\n - The Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) model\n - The Streamlined Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (SAPIC) model (for Itanium systems)\n - The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) model (for ARM systems)\n\n The MADT is a variable-sized structure consisting of a static header and then a variable number of entries.\n This type only contains the static portion, and then uses pointer arithmetic to parse the following entries.\n To make this sound, this type is `!Unpin` - this prevents you from getting anything other than a `Pin<&Madt>`\n out of a `PhysicalMapping`, thereby preventing a `Madt` from being moved before [`Madt::entries`] is called.\n",
