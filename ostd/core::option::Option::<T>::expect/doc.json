  "doc": " Returns the contained [`Some`] value, consuming the `self` value.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the value is a [`None`] with a custom panic message provided by\n `msg`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = Some(\"value\");\n assert_eq!(x.expect(\"fruits are healthy\"), \"value\");\n ```\n\n ```should_panic\n let x: Option<&str> = None;\n x.expect(\"fruits are healthy\"); // panics with `fruits are healthy`\n ```\n\n # Recommended Message Style\n\n We recommend that `expect` messages are used to describe the reason you\n _expect_ the `Option` should be `Some`.\n\n ```should_panic\n # let slice: &[u8] = &[];\n let item = slice.get(0)\n     .expect(\"slice should not be empty\");\n ```\n\n **Hint**: If you're having trouble remembering how to phrase expect\n error messages remember to focus on the word \"should\" as in \"env\n variable should be set by blah\" or \"the given binary should be available\n and executable by the current user\".\n\n For more detail on expect message styles and the reasoning behind our\n recommendation please refer to the section on [\"Common Message\n Styles\"](../../std/error/index.html#common-message-styles) in the [`std::error`](../../std/error/index.html) module docs.\n"
