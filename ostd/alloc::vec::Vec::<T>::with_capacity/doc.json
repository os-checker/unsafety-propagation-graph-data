  "doc": " Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>` with at least the specified capacity.\n\n The vector will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without\n reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than\n `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the vector will not allocate.\n\n It is important to note that although the returned vector has the\n minimum *capacity* specified, the vector will have a zero *length*. For\n an explanation of the difference between length and capacity, see\n *[Capacity and reallocation]*.\n\n If it is important to know the exact allocated capacity of a `Vec`,\n always use the [`capacity`] method after construction.\n\n For `Vec<T>` where `T` is a zero-sized type, there will be no allocation\n and the capacity will always be `usize::MAX`.\n\n [Capacity and reallocation]: #capacity-and-reallocation\n [`capacity`]: Vec::capacity\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` _bytes_.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);\n\n // The vector contains no items, even though it has capacity for more\n assert_eq!(vec.len(), 0);\n assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);\n\n // These are all done without reallocating...\n for i in 0..10 {\n     vec.push(i);\n }\n assert_eq!(vec.len(), 10);\n assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);\n\n // ...but this may make the vector reallocate\n vec.push(11);\n assert_eq!(vec.len(), 11);\n assert!(vec.capacity() >= 11);\n\n // A vector of a zero-sized type will always over-allocate, since no\n // allocation is necessary\n let vec_units = Vec::<()>::with_capacity(10);\n assert_eq!(vec_units.capacity(), usize::MAX);\n ```\n"
