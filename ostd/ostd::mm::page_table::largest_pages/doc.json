  "doc": " Splits the address range into largest page table items.\n\n Each of the returned items is a tuple of the physical address and the\n paging level. It is helpful when you want to map a physical address range\n into the provided virtual address.\n\n For example, on x86-64, `C: PageTableConfig` may specify level 1 page as\n 4KiB, level 2 page as 2MiB, and level 3 page as 1GiB. Suppose that the\n supplied physical address range is from `0x3fdff000` to `0x80002000`,\n and the virtual address is also `0x3fdff000`, the following 5 items will\n be returned:\n\n ```text\n 0x3fdff000                                                 0x80002000\n start                                                             end\n   |----|----------------|--------------------------------|----|----|\n    4KiB      2MiB                       1GiB              4KiB 4KiB\n ```\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if:\n  - any of `va`, `pa`, or `len` is not aligned to the base page size;\n  - the range `va..(va + len)` is not valid for the page table.\n"
