  "doc": " Copies the static CPU-local data on the bootstrap processor (BSP)\n for application processors (APs).\n\n # Safety\n\n This function must be called in the boot context of the BSP, at a time\n when the APs have not yet booted.\n\n The CPU-local data on the BSP must not be used before calling this\n function to copy it for the APs. Otherwise, the copied data will\n contain non-constant (also non-`Copy`) data, resulting in undefined\n behavior when it's loaded on the APs.\n\n The caller must ensure that the `num_cpus` matches the number of all\n CPUs that will access the CPU-local storage.\n"
