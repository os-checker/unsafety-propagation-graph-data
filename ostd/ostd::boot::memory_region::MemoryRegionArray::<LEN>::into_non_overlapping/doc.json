If an address is not in any region, it will be marked\n as [`MemoryRegionType::Unknown`].\n\n If any of the region boundaries are not page-aligned, they will be aligned\n according to the type of the region.\n\n # Panics\n\n This method will panic if the number of output regions is greater than `LEN`.\n"
