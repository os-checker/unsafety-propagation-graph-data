  "doc": " Stores a value into the bool, returning the previous value.\n\n `swap` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note:** This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on `u8`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\n let some_bool = AtomicBool::new(true);\n\n assert_eq!(some_bool.swap(false, Ordering::Relaxed), true);\n assert_eq!(some_bool.load(Ordering::Relaxed), false);\n ```\n"
