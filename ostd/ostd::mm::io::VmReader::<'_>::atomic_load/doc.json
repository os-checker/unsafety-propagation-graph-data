There are no\n synchronization constraints on other memory accesses. This aligns with the [Relaxed\n ordering](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order.html#Relaxed_ordering)\n specified in the C++11 memory model.\n\n This method will fail with errors if\n  1. the remaining space of the reader is less than `size_of::<T>()` bytes, or\n  2. the memory operation fails due to an unresolvable page fault.\n\n # Panics\n\n This method will panic if the memory location is not aligned on an `align_of::<T>()`-byte\n boundary.\n"
