  "doc": " Reads the current value of the processor’s time-stamp counter.\n\n The processor monotonically increments the time-stamp counter MSR\n every clock cycle and resets it to 0 whenever the processor is\n reset.\n\n The RDTSC instruction is not a serializing instruction. It does\n not necessarily wait until all previous instructions have been\n executed before reading the counter. Similarly, subsequent\n instructions may begin execution before the read operation is\n performed.\n\n On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the\n high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are cleared.\n\n [Intel's documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#text=_rdtsc)\n"
