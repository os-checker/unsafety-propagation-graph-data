  "doc": " Stores a value into the [`bool`] if the current value is the same as the `current` value.\n\n The return value is a result indicating whether the new value was written and containing\n the previous value. On success this value is guaranteed to be equal to `current`.\n\n `compare_exchange` takes two [`Ordering`] arguments to describe the memory\n ordering of this operation. `success` describes the required ordering for the\n read-modify-write operation that takes place if the comparison with `current` succeeds.\n `failure` describes the required ordering for the load operation that takes place when\n the comparison fails. Using [`Acquire`] as success ordering makes the store part\n of this operation [`Relaxed`], and using [`Release`] makes the successful load\n [`Relaxed`]. The failure ordering can only be [`SeqCst`], [`Acquire`] or [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note:** This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on `u8`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\n let some_bool = AtomicBool::new(true);\n\n assert_eq!(some_bool.compare_exchange(true,\n                                       false,\n                                       Ordering::Acquire,\n                                       Ordering::Relaxed),\n            Ok(true));\n assert_eq!(some_bool.load(Ordering::Relaxed), false);\n\n assert_eq!(some_bool.compare_exchange(true, true,\n                                       Ordering::SeqCst,\n                                       Ordering::Acquire),\n            Err(false));\n assert_eq!(some_bool.load(Ordering::Relaxed), false);\n ```\n\n # Considerations\n\n `compare_exchange` is a [compare-and-swap operation] and thus exhibits the usual downsides\n of CAS operations. In particular, a load of the value followed by a successful\n `compare_exchange` with the previous load *does not ensure* that other threads have not\n changed the value in the interim. This is usually important when the *equality* check in\n the `compare_exchange` is being used to check the *identity* of a value, but equality\n does not necessarily imply identity. In this case, `compare_exchange` can lead to the\n [ABA problem].\n\n [ABA Problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem\n [compare-and-swap operation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap\n"
