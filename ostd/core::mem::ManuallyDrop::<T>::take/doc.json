  "doc": " Takes the value from the `ManuallyDrop<T>` container out.\n\n This method is primarily intended for moving out values in drop.\n Instead of using [`ManuallyDrop::drop`] to manually drop the value,\n you can use this method to take the value and use it however desired.\n\n Whenever possible, it is preferable to use [`into_inner`][`ManuallyDrop::into_inner`]\n instead, which prevents duplicating the content of the `ManuallyDrop<T>`.\n\n # Safety\n\n This function semantically moves out the contained value without preventing further usage,\n leaving the state of this container unchanged.\n It is your responsibility to ensure that this `ManuallyDrop` is not used again.\n\n"
