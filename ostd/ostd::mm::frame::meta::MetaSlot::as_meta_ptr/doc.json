Specifically, the derefernecer should ensure that:\n  - the stored metadata is initialized (by [`Self::write_meta`]) and\n    valid;\n  - the initialized metadata is of type `M`;\n  - the returned pointer should not be dereferenced as mutable unless\n    having exclusive access to the metadata slot.\n"
