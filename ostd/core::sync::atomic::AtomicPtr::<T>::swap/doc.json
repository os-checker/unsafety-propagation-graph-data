  "doc": " Stores a value into the pointer, returning the previous value.\n\n `swap` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note:** This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on pointers.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering};\n\n let ptr = &mut 5;\n let some_ptr = AtomicPtr::new(ptr);\n\n let other_ptr = &mut 10;\n\n let value = some_ptr.swap(other_ptr, Ordering::Relaxed);\n ```\n"
