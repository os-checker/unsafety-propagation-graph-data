  "doc": " Deallocates a contiguous range of frames.\n\n The caller guarantees that `addr` and `size` are both aligned to\n [`PAGE_SIZE`]. The deallocated memory should always be allocated by\n [`GlobalFrameAllocator::alloc`]. However, if\n [`GlobalFrameAllocator::alloc`] returns multiple frames, it is possible\n that some of them are deallocated before others. The deallocated memory\n must never overlap with any memory that is already deallocated or\n added, without being allocated in between.\n\n The deallocated memory can be uninitialized.\n"
