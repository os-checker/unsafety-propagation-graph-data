  "doc": " Applies the operation to the next slot of mapping within the range.\n\n The range to be found in is the current virtual address with the\n provided length.\n\n The function stops and yields the actually protected range if it has\n actually protected a page, no matter if the following pages are also\n required to be protected.\n\n It also makes the cursor moves forward to the next page after the\n protected one. If no mapped pages exist in the following range, the\n cursor will stop at the end of the range and return [`None`].\n\n Note that it will **NOT** flush the TLB after the operation. Please\n make the decision yourself on when and how to flush the TLB using\n [`Self::flusher`].\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the length is longer than the remaining range of the cursor.\n"
