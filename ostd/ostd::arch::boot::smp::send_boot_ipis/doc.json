For\n APs that have been started, this signal will not bring any cost.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that all application processors can be\n safely booted by ensuring that:\n 1. We're in the boot context of the BSP and all APs have not yet\n    been booted.\n 2. We've properly prepared all the resources for the application\n    processors to boot successfully (e.g., each AP's page table\n    and stack).\n"
