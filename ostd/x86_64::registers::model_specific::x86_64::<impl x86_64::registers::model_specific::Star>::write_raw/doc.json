SS.Sel is set to\n this field + 8. Because SYSRET always returns to CPL 3, the\n RPL bits 1:0 should be initialized to 11b.\n - syscall: This field is copied directly into CS.Sel. SS.Sel is set to\n  this field + 8. Because SYSCALL always switches to CPL 0, the RPL bits\n 33:32 should be initialized to 00b.\n\n # Safety\n\n Unsafe because this can cause system instability if passed in the\n wrong values for the fields.\n"
