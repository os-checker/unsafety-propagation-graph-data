  "doc": " Loads the value of the set with the given ordering.\n\n This operation is not atomic. When racing with a [`Self::store`]\n operation, this load may return a set that contains a portion of the\n new value and a portion of the old value. Load on each specific\n word is atomic, and follows the specified ordering.\n\n Note that load with [`Ordering::Release`] is a valid operation, which\n is different from the normal atomic operations. When coupled with\n [`Ordering::Release`], it actually performs `fetch_or(0, Release)`.\n"
