Due to the conversion,\n any existing data on the pages will be zeroed.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that:\n  - The provided physical address is page aligned.\n  - The provided physical address range is in bounds, i.e., it should fall\n    within the maximum Guest Physical Address (GPA) limit.\n  - All of the physical pages are untyped memory. Therefore, converting and\n    erasing the data will not cause memory safety issues.\n"
