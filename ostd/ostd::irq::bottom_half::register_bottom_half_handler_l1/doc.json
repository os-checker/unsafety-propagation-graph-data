  "doc": " Registers a bottom half callback to be executed at interrupt level 1.\n\n The callback takes a [`DisabledLocalIrqGuard`] as the first argument.\n This allows the callback to drop the guard\n in order to re-enable IRQs on the current CPU.\n The callback requires returning a `DisabledLocalIrqGuard`,\n thus ensuring that local IRQs are disabled by the end of the callback.\n The second argument is the IRQ number being processed.\n\n The function may be called only once; subsequent calls take no effect.\n"
