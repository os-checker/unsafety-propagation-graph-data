  "doc": " Marks all the nodes in the sub-tree rooted at the node as stray, and\n returns the num of pages mapped within the sub-tree.\n\n It must be called upon the node after the node is removed from the parent\n page table. It also unlocks the nodes in the sub-tree.\n\n This function returns the number of physical frames mapped in the sub-tree.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that all the nodes in the sub-tree are locked\n and all guards are forgotten.\n\n This function must not be called upon a shared node, e.g., the second-\n top level nodes that the kernel space and user space share.\n"
