  "doc": " Creates a VE handler.\n\n It is important that such a handler is created immediately after a VE happens,\n before the local IRQs are re-enabled. This is because the handler needs to retrieve more information\n about the last VE from the trusted Intel TDX module. If another VE happens, the information about\n the last one held by Intel TDX module would be overridden and lost!\n\n This constructor method retrieves the VE information from\n Intel TDX module and saved into the newly-created instance.\n So after instantiating a `VirtualizationExceptionHandler`,\n we won't need to worry about triggering a new VE.\n"
