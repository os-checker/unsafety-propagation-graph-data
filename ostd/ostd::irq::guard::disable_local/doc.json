  "doc": " Disables all IRQs on the current CPU (i.e., locally).\n\n This function returns a guard object, which will automatically enable local IRQs again when\n it is dropped. This function works correctly even when it is called in a _nested_ way.\n The local IRQs shall only be re-enabled when the most outer guard is dropped.\n\n This function can play nicely with [`SpinLock`] as the type uses this function internally.\n One can invoke this function even after acquiring a spin lock. And the reversed order is also ok.\n\n [`SpinLock`]: crate::sync::SpinLock\n\n # Example\n\n ```rust\n use ostd::irq;\n\n {\n     let _ = irq::disable_local();\n     todo!(\"do something when irqs are disabled\");\n }\n ```\n"
