  "doc": " Construct a new `PhysicalMapping`.\n\n - `physical_start` should be the physical address of the structure to be mapped.\n - `virtual_start` should be the corresponding virtual address of that structure. It may differ from the\n   start of the region mapped due to requirements of the paging system. It must be a valid, non-null\n   pointer.\n - `region_length` should be the number of bytes requested to be mapped. It must be equal to or larger than\n   `size_of::<T>()`.\n - `mapped_length` should be the number of bytes mapped to fulfill the request. It may be equal to or larger\n   than `region_length`, due to requirements of the paging system or other reasoning.\n - `handler` should be the same `AcpiHandler` that created the mapping. When the `PhysicalMapping` is\n   dropped, it will be used to unmap the structure.\n\n ### Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that the physical memory can be safely mapped.\n"
