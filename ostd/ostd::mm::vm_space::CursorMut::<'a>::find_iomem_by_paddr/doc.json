  "doc": " Finds an [`IoMem`] that was previously mapped to by [`Self::map_iomem`] and contains the\n physical address.\n\n This method can recover the originally mapped `IoMem` from the physical address returned by\n [`Self::query`]. If the query returns a [`VmQueriedItem::MappedIoMem`], this method is\n guaranteed to succeed with the specific physical address. However, if the corresponding\n mapping is subsequently unmapped, it is unspecified whether this method will still succeed\n or not.\n\n On success, this method returns the `IoMem` and the offset from the `IoMem` start to the\n given physical address. Otherwise, this method returns `None`.\n"
