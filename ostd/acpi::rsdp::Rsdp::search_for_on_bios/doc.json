  "doc": " This searches for a RSDP on BIOS systems.\n\n ### Safety\n This function probes memory in three locations:\n    - It reads a word from `40:0e` to locate the EBDA.\n    - The first 1KiB of the EBDA (Extended BIOS Data Area).\n    - The BIOS memory area at `0xe0000..=0xfffff`.\n\n This should be fine on all BIOS systems. However, UEFI platforms are free to put the RSDP wherever they\n please, so this won't always find the RSDP. Further, prodding these memory locations may have unintended\n side-effects. On UEFI systems, the RSDP should be found in the Configuration Table, using two GUIDs:\n     - ACPI v1.0 structures use `eb9d2d30-2d88-11d3-9a16-0090273fc14d`.\n     - ACPI v2.0 or later structures use `8868e871-e4f1-11d3-bc22-0080c73c8881`.\n You should search the entire table for the v2.0 GUID before searching for the v1.0 one.\n"
