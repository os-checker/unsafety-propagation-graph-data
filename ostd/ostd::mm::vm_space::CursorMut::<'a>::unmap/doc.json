  "doc": " Clears the mapping starting from the current slot,\n and returns the number of unmapped pages.\n\n This method will bring the cursor forward by `len` bytes in the virtual\n address space after the modification.\n\n Already-absent mappings encountered by the cursor will be skipped. It\n is valid to unmap a range that is not mapped.\n\n It must issue and dispatch a TLB flush after the operation. Otherwise,\n the memory safety will be compromised. Please call this function less\n to avoid the overhead of TLB flush. Using a large `len` is wiser than\n splitting the operation into multiple small ones.\n\n # Panics\n Panics if:\n  - the length is longer than the remaining range of the cursor;\n  - the length is not page-aligned.\n"
