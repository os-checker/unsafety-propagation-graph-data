  "doc": " Load the task state register using the `ltr` instruction.\n\n Note that loading a TSS segment selector marks the corresponding TSS\n Descriptor in the GDT as \"busy\", preventing it from being loaded again\n (either on this CPU or another CPU). TSS structures (including Descriptors\n and Selectors) should generally be per-CPU. See\n [`tss_segment`](crate::structures::gdt::Descriptor::tss_segment)\n for more information.\n\n Calling `load_tss` with a busy TSS selector results in a `#GP` exception.\n\n ## Safety\n\n This function is unsafe because the caller must ensure that the given\n `SegmentSelector` points to a valid TSS entry in the GDT and that the\n corresponding data in the TSS is valid.\n"
