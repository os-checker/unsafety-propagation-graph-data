  "doc": " Converts back from a raw pointer.\n\n # Safety\n\n 1. The raw pointer must have been previously returned by a call to\n    `into_raw`.\n 2. The raw pointer must not be used after calling `from_raw`.\n\n Note that the second point is a hard requirement: Even if the\n resulting value has not (yet) been dropped, the pointer cannot be\n used because it may break Rust aliasing rules (e.g., `Box<T>`\n requires the pointer to be unique and thus _never_ aliased).\n"
