  "doc": " Returns a reference to the inner value on the unchecked assumption that the  [`Once`] has been initialized.\n\n # Safety\n\n This is *extremely* unsafe if the `Once` has not already been initialized because a reference to uninitialized\n memory will be returned, immediately triggering undefined behaviour (even if the reference goes unused).\n However, this can be useful in some instances for exposing the `Once` to FFI or when the overhead of atomically\n checking initialization is unacceptable and the `Once` has already been initialized.\n"
