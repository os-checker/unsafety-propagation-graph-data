  "doc": " Turns the given pointer into a `VolatileRef`.\n\n ## Safety\n\n - The pointer must be properly aligned.\n - It must be “dereferenceable” in the sense defined in the [`core::ptr`] documentation.\n - The pointer must point to an initialized instance of T.\n - You must enforce Rust’s aliasing rules, since the returned lifetime 'a is arbitrarily\n   chosen and does not necessarily reflect the actual lifetime of the data. In particular,\n   while this `VolatileRef` exists, the memory the pointer points to must not get accessed\n   (_read or written_) through any other pointer.\n"
