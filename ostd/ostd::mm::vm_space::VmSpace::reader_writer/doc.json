  "doc": " Creates a reader/writer pair to read data from and write data into the user space.\n\n Returns `Err` if this `VmSpace` doesn't belong to the user space of the current task\n or the `vaddr` and `len` do not represent a user space memory range.\n\n Users must ensure that no other page table is activated in the current task during the\n lifetime of the created `VmReader` and `VmWriter`. This guarantees that the `VmReader`\n and the `VmWriter` can operate correctly.\n\n This method is semantically equivalent to calling [`Self::reader`] and [`Self::writer`]\n separately, but it avoids double checking the validity of the memory region.\n"
