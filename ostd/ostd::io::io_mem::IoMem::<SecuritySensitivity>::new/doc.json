The given physical address range must be in the I/O memory region.\n 3. Reading from or writing to I/O memory regions may have side effects.\n    If `SecuritySensitivity` is `Insensitive`, those side effects must\n    not cause soundness problems (e.g., they must not corrupt the kernel\n    memory).\n"
