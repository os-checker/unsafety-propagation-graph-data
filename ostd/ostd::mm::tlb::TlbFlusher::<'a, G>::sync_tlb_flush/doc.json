  "doc": " Waits for all the previous TLB flush requests to be completed.\n\n After this function, all TLB entries corresponding to previous\n dispatched TLB flush requests are guaranteed to be coherent.\n\n The TLB flush requests are issued with [`Self::issue_tlb_flush`] and\n dispatched with [`Self::dispatch_tlb_flush`]. This method will not\n dispatch any issued requests so it will not guarantee TLB coherence\n of requests that are not dispatched.\n\n # Panics\n\n This method panics if the IRQs are disabled. Since the remote flush are\n processed in IRQs, two CPUs may deadlock if they are waiting for each\n other's TLB coherence.\n"
