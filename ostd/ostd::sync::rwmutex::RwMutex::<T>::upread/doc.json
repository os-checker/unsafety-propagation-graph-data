  "doc": " Acquires a upread mutex and sleep until it can be acquired.\n\n The calling thread will sleep until there are no writers or upreaders present.\n The implementation of [`WaitQueue`] guarantees the order in which other concurrent\n readers or writers waiting simultaneously will acquire the mutex.\n\n Upreader will not block new readers until it tries to upgrade. Upreader\n and reader do not differ before invoking the upgread method. However,\n only one upreader can exist at any time to avoid deadlock in the\n upgread method.\n"
