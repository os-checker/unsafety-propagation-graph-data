  "doc": " Acquires an upreader and spin-wait until it can be acquired.\n\n The calling thread will spin-wait until there are no other writers,\n or upreaders. There is no guarantee for the order in which other\n readers or writers waiting simultaneously will obtain the lock.\n\n Upreader will not block new readers until it tries to upgrade. Upreader\n and reader do not differ before invoking the upgread method. However,\n only one upreader can exist at any time to avoid deadlock in the\n upgread method.\n"
