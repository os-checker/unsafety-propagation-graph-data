  "doc": " Maps the item starting from the current address to a physical address range.\n\n If the current address has already mapped pages, it will do a re-map,\n taking out the old physical address and replacing it with the new one.\n This function will return [`Err`] with a [`PageTableFrag`], the not\n mapped item. The caller should drop it after TLB coherence.\n\n If there is no mapped pages in the specified virtual address range,\n the function will return [`None`].\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if\n  - the virtual address range to be mapped is out of the locked range;\n  - the current virtual address is not aligned to the page size of the\n    item to be mapped;\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller should ensure that\n  - the range being mapped does not affect kernel's memory safety;\n  - the physical address to be mapped is valid and safe to use;\n"
