  "doc": " Delays the dropping of a [`NonNullPtr`] after the RCU grace period.\n\n This is internally needed for implementing [`Rcu`] and [`RcuOption`]\n because we cannot alias a [`Box`]. Restoring `P` and use [`RcuDrop`] for it\n can lead to multiple [`Box`]es simultaneously pointing to the same\n content.\n\n # Safety\n\n The pointer must be previously returned by `into_raw`, will not be used\n after the end of the current grace period, and will only be dropped once.\n\n [`Box`]: alloc::boxed::Box\n"
