  "doc": " Finds and removes the first page table fragment in the following range.\n\n The range to be found in is the current virtual address with the\n provided length.\n\n The function stops and yields the fragment if it has actually removed a\n fragment, no matter if the following pages are also required to be\n unmapped. The returned virtual address is the virtual page that existed\n before the removal but having just been unmapped.\n\n It also makes the cursor moves forward to the next page after the\n removed one, when an actual page is removed. If no mapped pages exist\n in the following range, the cursor will stop at the end of the range\n and return [`None`].\n\n The caller should handle TLB coherence if necessary, using the returned\n virtual address range.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller should ensure that the range being unmapped does not affect\n kernel's memory safety.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if:\n  - the length is longer than the remaining range of the cursor;\n  - the length is not page-aligned.\n"
