  "doc": " Reads a value of the `PodOnce` type at the specified offset using one\n non-tearing memory load.\n\n Except that the offset is specified explicitly, the semantics of this\n method is the same as [`VmReader::read_once`].\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that the offset and the read operation is valid,\n e.g., follows the specification when used for implementing drivers, does\n not cause any out-of-bounds access, and does not cause unsound side\n effects (e.g., corrupting the kernel memory).\n"
