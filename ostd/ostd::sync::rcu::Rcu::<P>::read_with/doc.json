  "doc": " Reads the RCU-protected value in an atomic mode.\n\n The RCU mechanism protects reads ([`Self::read`]) by entering an\n atomic mode. If we are already in an atomic mode, this function can\n reduce the overhead of disabling preemption again.\n\n Unlike [`Self::read`], this function does not return a read guard, so\n you cannot use [`RcuReadGuard::compare_exchange`] to synchronize the\n writers. You may do it via a [`super::SpinLock`].\n"
