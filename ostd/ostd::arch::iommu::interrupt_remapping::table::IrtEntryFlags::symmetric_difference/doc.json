Equivalently, it contains the flags present in *exactly\n one* of the sets `self` and `other`.\n\n This is equivalent to using the `^` operator (e.g.\n [`ops::BitXor`]), as in `flags ^ other`.\n\n [sym-diff]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference\n [`ops::BitXor`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.BitXor.html\n"
