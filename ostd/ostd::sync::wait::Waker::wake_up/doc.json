It returns `false` if the\n waiter has already been woken by a previous call to the method, or if the waiter has been\n dropped.\n\n Note that if this method returns `true`, it implies that the wake event will be properly\n delivered, _or_ that the waiter will be dropped after being woken. It's up to the caller to\n handle the latter case properly to avoid missing the wake event.\n"
