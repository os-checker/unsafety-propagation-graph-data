  "doc": " Atomically compares and exchanges a `PodAtomic` value.\n\n This method compares `old_val` with the value pointed by `self` and, if they are equal,\n updates it with `new_val`.\n\n The value that was previously in memory will be returned, along with a boolean denoting\n whether the compare-and-exchange succeeds. The caller usually wants to retry if this\n flag is false, passing the most recent value that was returned by this method.\n\n The caller is required to provide a reader which points to the exact same memory location\n to ensure that reading from the memory is allowed.\n\n Regardless of whether it is successful, the cursors of the reader and writer will not move.\n\n This method only guarantees the atomicity of the specific operation. There are no\n synchronization constraints on other memory accesses. This aligns with the [Relaxed\n ordering](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order.html#Relaxed_ordering)\n specified in the C++11 memory model.\n\n Since the operation does not involve memory locks, it can't prevent the [ABA\n problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem).\n\n This method will fail with errors if:\n  1. the remaining space of the reader or the available space of the writer are less than\n     `size_of::<T>()` bytes, or\n  2. the memory operation fails due to an unresolvable page fault.\n\n # Panics\n\n This method will panic if:\n  1. the reader and the writer does not point to the same memory location, or\n  2. the memory location is not aligned on an `align_of::<T>()`-byte boundary.\n"
