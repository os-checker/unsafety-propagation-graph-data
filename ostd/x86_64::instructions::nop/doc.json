  "doc": " Executes the `nop` instructions, which performs no operation (i.e. does nothing).\n\n This operation is useful to work around the LLVM bug that endless loops are illegally\n optimized away (see [the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28728)). By invoking this\n instruction (which is marked as volatile), the compiler should no longer optimize the\n endless loop away.\n"
