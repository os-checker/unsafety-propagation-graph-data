      "doc": " Returns the size of a type in bytes.\n\n More specifically, this is the offset in bytes between successive elements\n in an array with that item type including alignment padding. Thus, for any\n type `T` and length `n`, `[T; n]` has a size of `n * size_of::<T>()`.\n\n In general, the size of a type is not stable across compilations, but\n specific types such as primitives are.\n\n The following table gives the size for primitives.\n\n Type | `size_of::<Type>()`\n ---- | ---------------\n () | 0\n bool | 1\n u8 | 1\n u16 | 2\n u32 | 4\n u64 | 8\n u128 | 16\n i8 | 1\n i16 | 2\n i32 | 4\n i64 | 8\n i128 | 16\n f32 | 4\n f64 | 8\n char | 4\n\n Furthermore, `usize` and `isize` have the same size.\n\n The types [`*const T`], `&T`, [`Box<T>`], [`Option<&T>`], and `Option<Box<T>>` all have\n the same size. If `T` is `Sized`, all of those types have the same size as `usize`.\n\n The mutability of a pointer does not change its size. As such, `&T` and `&mut T`\n have the same size. Likewise for `*const T` and `*mut T`.\n\n # Size of `#[repr(C)]` items\n\n The `C` representation for items has a defined layout. With this layout,\n the size of items is also stable as long as all fields have a stable size.\n\n ## Size of Structs\n\n For `struct`s, the size is determined by the following algorithm.\n\n For each field in the struct ordered by declaration order:\n\n 1. Add the size of the field.\n 2. Round up the current size to the nearest multiple of the next field's [alignment].\n\n Finally, round the size of the struct to the nearest multiple of its [alignment].\n The alignment of the struct is usually the largest alignment of all its\n fields; this can be changed with the use of `repr(align(N))`.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized structs are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n ## Size of Enums\n\n Enums that carry no data other than the discriminant have the same size as C enums\n on the platform they are compiled for.\n\n ## Size of Unions\n\n The size of a union is the size of its largest field.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized unions are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Some primitives\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<i32>());\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<f64>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<()>());\n\n // Some arrays\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<[i32; 2]>());\n assert_eq!(12, size_of::<[i32; 3]>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<[i32; 0]>());\n\n\n // Pointer size equality\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<*const i32>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Box<i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Option<&i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<Box<i32>>(), size_of::<Option<Box<i32>>>());\n ```\n\n Using `#[repr(C)]`.\n\n ```\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStruct {\n     first: u8,\n     second: u16,\n     third: u8\n }\n\n // The size of the first field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 1.\n // The alignment of the second field is 2, so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 2.\n // The size of the second field is 2, so add 2 to the size. Size is 4.\n // The alignment of the third field is 1, so add 0 to the size for padding. Size is 4.\n // The size of the third field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 5.\n // Finally, the alignment of the struct is 2 (because the largest alignment amongst its\n // fields is 2), so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 6.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<FieldStruct>());\n\n #[repr(C)]\n struct TupleStruct(u8, u16, u8);\n\n // Tuple structs follow the same rules.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<TupleStruct>());\n\n // Note that reordering the fields can lower the size. We can remove both padding bytes\n // by putting `third` before `second`.\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStructOptimized {\n     first: u8,\n     third: u8,\n     second: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<FieldStructOptimized>());\n\n // Union size is the size of the largest field.\n #[repr(C)]\n union ExampleUnion {\n     smaller: u8,\n     larger: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(2, size_of::<ExampleUnion>());\n ```\n\n [alignment]: align_of\n [`*const T`]: primitive@pointer\n [`Box<T>`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html\n [`Option<&T>`]: crate::option::Option\n\n",

      "doc": " Performs a volatile read of the value from `src` without moving it.\n\n Volatile operations are intended to act on I/O memory. As such, they are considered externally\n observable events (just like syscalls, but less opaque), and are guaranteed to not be elided or\n reordered by the compiler across other externally observable events. With this in mind, there\n are two cases of usage that need to be distinguished:\n\n - When a volatile operation is used for memory inside an [allocation], it behaves exactly like\n   [`read`], except for the additional guarantee that it won't be elided or reordered (see\n   above). This implies that the operation will actually access memory and not e.g. be lowered to\n   reusing data from a previous read. Other than that, all the usual rules for memory accesses\n   apply (including provenance).  In particular, just like in C, whether an operation is volatile\n   has no bearing whatsoever on questions involving concurrent accesses from multiple threads.\n   Volatile accesses behave exactly like non-atomic accesses in that regard.\n\n - Volatile operations, however, may also be used to access memory that is _outside_ of any Rust\n   allocation. In this use-case, the pointer does *not* have to be [valid] for reads. This is\n   typically used for CPU and peripheral registers that must be accessed via an I/O memory\n   mapping, most commonly at fixed addresses reserved by the hardware. These often have special\n   semantics associated to their manipulation, and cannot be used as general purpose memory.\n   Here, any address value is possible, including 0 and [`usize::MAX`], so long as the semantics\n   of such a read are well-defined by the target hardware. The provenance of the pointer is\n   irrelevant, and it can be created with [`without_provenance`]. The access must not trap. It\n   can cause side-effects, but those must not affect Rust-allocated memory in any way. This\n   access is still not considered [atomic], and as such it cannot be used for inter-thread\n   synchronization.\n\n Note that volatile memory operations where T is a zero-sized type are noops and may be ignored.\n\n [allocation]: crate::ptr#allocated-object\n [atomic]: crate::sync::atomic#memory-model-for-atomic-accesses\n\n # Safety\n\n Like [`read`], `read_volatile` creates a bitwise copy of `T`, regardless of whether `T` is\n [`Copy`]. If `T` is not [`Copy`], using both the returned value and the value at `*src` can\n [violate memory safety][read-ownership]. However, storing non-[`Copy`] types in volatile memory\n is almost certainly incorrect.\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `src` must be either [valid] for reads, or it must point to memory outside of all Rust\n   allocations and reading from that memory must:\n   - not trap, and\n   - not cause any memory inside a Rust allocation to be modified.\n\n * `src` must be properly aligned.\n\n * Reading from `src` must produce a properly initialized value of type `T`.\n\n Note that even if `T` has size `0`, the pointer must be properly aligned.\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n [read-ownership]: read#ownership-of-the-returned-value\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let x = 12;\n let y = &x as *const i32;\n\n unsafe {\n     assert_eq!(std::ptr::read_volatile(y), 12);\n }\n ```\n",
