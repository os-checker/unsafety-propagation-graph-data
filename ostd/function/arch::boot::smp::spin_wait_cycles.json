      "doc": " Emits a machine instruction to signal the processor that it is running in\n a busy-wait spin-loop (\"spin lock\").\n\n Upon receiving the spin-loop signal the processor can optimize its behavior by,\n for example, saving power or switching hyper-threads.\n\n This function is different from [`thread::yield_now`] which directly\n yields to the system's scheduler, whereas `spin_loop` does not interact\n with the operating system.\n\n A common use case for `spin_loop` is implementing bounded optimistic\n spinning in a CAS loop in synchronization primitives. To avoid problems\n like priority inversion, it is strongly recommended that the spin loop is\n terminated after a finite amount of iterations and an appropriate blocking\n syscall is made.\n\n **Note**: On platforms that do not support receiving spin-loop hints this\n function does not do anything at all.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```ignore-wasm\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n use std::sync::Arc;\n use std::{hint, thread};\n\n // A shared atomic value that threads will use to coordinate\n let live = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));\n\n // In a background thread we'll eventually set the value\n let bg_work = {\n     let live = live.clone();\n     thread::spawn(move || {\n         // Do some work, then make the value live\n         do_some_work();\n         live.store(true, Ordering::Release);\n     })\n };\n\n // Back on our current thread, we wait for the value to be set\n while !live.load(Ordering::Acquire) {\n     // The spin loop is a hint to the CPU that we're waiting, but probably\n     // not for very long\n     hint::spin_loop();\n }\n\n // The value is now set\n # fn do_some_work() {}\n do_some_work();\n bg_work.join()?;\n # Ok::<(), Box<dyn core::any::Any + Send + 'static>>(())\n ```\n\n [`thread::yield_now`]: ../../std/thread/fn.yield_now.html\n",
