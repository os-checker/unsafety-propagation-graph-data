It does\n not necessarily wait until all previous instructions have been\n executed before reading the counter. Similarly, subsequent\n instructions may begin execution before the read operation is\n performed.\n\n On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the\n high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are cleared.\n\n [Intel's documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#text=_rdtsc)\n",
