  "doc": " Initializes the allocatable MMIO area based on the x86-64 memory distribution map.\n\n In x86-64, the available physical memory area is divided into two regions below 32 bits (Low memory)\n and above (High memory). The area from the top of low memory to 0xffff_ffff and the area after the\n top of high memory are available MMIO areas.\n\n This memory layout is documented in Intel's datasheets. The MMIO area is defined by specific\n registers that are configured by the BIOS and locked down, preventing the OS from reconfiguring\n them. For the details, one can read the \"Processor Configuration Register Definitions and\n Address Ranges\" section in the \"10th Generation Intel(R) Processor Families\" datasheet\n (<https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/10th-gen-core-families-datasheet-vol-2-datasheet.pdf>).\n However, note that these specifics may differ between CPU generations and those manufactured by\n other vendors.\n\n # Safety\n\n 1. This function must be called only once in the boot context of the\n    bootstrapping processor.\n 2. This function must be called after the kernel page table is activated on\n    the bootstrapping processor.\n"
