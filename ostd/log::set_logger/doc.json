  "doc": " Sets the global logger to a `&'static Log`.\n\n This function may only be called once in the lifetime of a program. Any log\n events that occur before the call to `set_logger` completes will be ignored.\n\n This function does not typically need to be called manually. Logger\n implementations should provide an initialization method that installs the\n logger internally.\n\n # Availability\n\n This method is available even when the `std` feature is disabled. However,\n it is currently unavailable on `thumbv6` targets, which lack support for\n some atomic operations which are used by this function. Even on those\n targets, [`set_logger_racy`] will be available.\n\n # Errors\n\n An error is returned if a logger has already been set.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use log::{error, info, warn, Record, Level, Metadata, LevelFilter};\n\n static MY_LOGGER: MyLogger = MyLogger;\n\n struct MyLogger;\n\n impl log::Log for MyLogger {\n     fn enabled(&self, metadata: &Metadata) -> bool {\n         metadata.level() <= Level::Info\n     }\n\n     fn log(&self, record: &Record) {\n         if self.enabled(record.metadata()) {\n             println!(\"{} - {}\", record.level(), record.args());\n         }\n     }\n     fn flush(&self) {}\n }\n\n # fn main(){\n log::set_logger(&MY_LOGGER).unwrap();\n log::set_max_level(LevelFilter::Info);\n\n info!(\"hello log\");\n warn!(\"warning\");\n error!(\"oops\");\n # }\n ```\n\n [`set_logger_racy`]: fn.set_logger_racy.html\n"
