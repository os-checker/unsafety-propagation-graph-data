  "doc": " Creates an iterator starting at the same point, but stepping by\n the given amount at each iteration.\n\n Note 1: The first element of the iterator will always be returned,\n regardless of the step given.\n\n Note 2: The time at which ignored elements are pulled is not fixed.\n `StepBy` behaves like the sequence `self.next()`, `self.nth(step-1)`,\n `self.nth(step-1)`, …, but is also free to behave like the sequence\n `advance_n_and_return_first(&mut self, step)`,\n `advance_n_and_return_first(&mut self, step)`, …\n Which way is used may change for some iterators for performance reasons.\n The second way will advance the iterator earlier and may consume more items.\n\n `advance_n_and_return_first` is the equivalent of:\n ```\n fn advance_n_and_return_first<I>(iter: &mut I, n: usize) -> Option<I::Item>\n where\n     I: Iterator,\n {\n     let next = iter.next();\n     if n > 1 {\n         iter.nth(n - 2);\n     }\n     next\n }\n ```\n\n # Panics\n\n The method will panic if the given step is `0`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().step_by(2);\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(0));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(4));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n"
