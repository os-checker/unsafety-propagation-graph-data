  "doc": " Allocates a region of physical memory for streaming DMA access.\n\n The memory of the newly-allocated DMA buffer is initialized to zeros.\n This method is only available when `D` is [`ToDevice`] or\n [`FromAndToDevice`], as zeroing requires write access to the buffer.\n\n The `is_cache_coherent` argument specifies whether the target device\n that the DMA mapping is prepared for can access the main memory in a\n CPU cache coherent way or not.\n\n # Comparison with [`DmaStream::map`]\n\n This method is semantically equivalent to allocating a [`USegment`] via\n [`FrameAllocOptions::alloc_segment`] and then mapping it with\n [`DmaStream::map`]. However, [`DmaStream::alloc`] combines these two\n operations and can be more efficient in certain scenarios, particularly\n in confidential VMs, where the overhead of bounce buffers can be\n avoided.\n"
