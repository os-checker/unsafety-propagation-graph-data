  "doc": " Determines if a log message with the specified metadata would be\n logged.\n\n This is used by the `log_enabled!` macro to allow callers to avoid\n expensive computation of log message arguments if the message would be\n discarded anyway.\n\n # For implementors\n\n This method isn't called automatically by the `log!` macros.\n It's up to an implementation of the `Log` trait to call `enabled` in its own\n `log` method implementation to guarantee that filtering is applied.\n"
