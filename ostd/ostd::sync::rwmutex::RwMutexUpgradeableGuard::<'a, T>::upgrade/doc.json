  "doc": " Upgrades this upread guard to a write guard atomically.\n\n After calling this method, subsequent readers will be blocked\n while previous readers remain unaffected.\n\n The calling thread will not sleep, but spin to wait for the existing\n reader to be released. There are two main reasons.\n - First, it needs to sleep in an extra waiting queue and needs extra wake-up logic and overhead.\n - Second, upgrading method usually requires a high response time (because the mutex is being used now).\n"
