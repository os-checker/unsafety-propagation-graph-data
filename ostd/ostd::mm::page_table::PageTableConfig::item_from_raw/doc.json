  "doc": " Restores the item from the physical address and the paging level.\n\n There could be transformations after [`PageTableConfig::item_into_raw`]\n and before [`PageTableConfig::item_from_raw`], which include:\n  - splitting and coalescing the items, for example, splitting one item\n    into 512 `level - 1` items with and contiguous physical addresses;\n  - protecting the items, for example, changing the page property.\n\n Splitting and coalescing maintains ownership rules, i.e., if one\n physical address is within the range of one item, after splitting/\n coalescing, there should be exactly one item that contains the address.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that:\n  - the physical address and the paging level represent a page table\n    item or part of it (as described above);\n  - either the ownership of the item is properly transferred to the\n    return value, or the return value is wrapped in a\n    [`core::mem::ManuallyDrop`] that won't outlive the original item;\n  - the [`super::PageFlags::AVAIL1`] flag is preserved, i.e., it is\n    the same as that returned from [`PageTableConfig::item_into_raw`].\n"
