  "doc": " Returns `true` if the address is a unicast address with link-local scope,\n as defined in [RFC 4291].\n\n A unicast address has link-local scope if it has the prefix `fe80::/10`, as per [RFC 4291 section 2.4].\n Note that this encompasses more addresses than those defined in [RFC 4291 section 2.5.6],\n which describes \"Link-Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses\" as having the following stricter format:\n\n ```text\n | 10 bits  |         54 bits         |          64 bits           |\n +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+\n |1111111010|           0             |       interface ID         |\n +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+\n ```\n So while currently the only addresses with link-local scope an application will encounter are all in `fe80::/64`,\n this might change in the future with the publication of new standards. More addresses in `fe80::/10` could be allocated,\n and those addresses will have link-local scope.\n\n Also note that while [RFC 4291 section 2.5.3] mentions about the [loopback address] (`::1`) that \"it is treated as having Link-Local scope\",\n this does not mean that the loopback address actually has link-local scope and this method will return `false` on it.\n\n [RFC 4291]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291\n [RFC 4291 section 2.4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.4\n [RFC 4291 section 2.5.3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.3\n [RFC 4291 section 2.5.6]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.6\n [loopback address]: Ipv6Addr::LOCALHOST\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::net::Ipv6Addr;\n\n // The loopback address (`::1`) does not actually have link-local scope.\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::LOCALHOST.is_unicast_link_local(), false);\n\n // Only addresses in `fe80::/10` have link-local scope.\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0x2001, 0xdb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).is_unicast_link_local(), false);\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0xfe80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).is_unicast_link_local(), true);\n\n // Addresses outside the stricter `fe80::/64` also have link-local scope.\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0xfe80, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0).is_unicast_link_local(), true);\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0xfe81, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).is_unicast_link_local(), true);\n ```\n"
