  "doc": " Calculates the quotient of Euclidean division `self.div_euclid(rhs)`.\n\n Returns a tuple of the divisor along with a boolean indicating\n whether an arithmetic overflow would occur. Note that for unsigned\n integers overflow never occurs, so the second value is always\n `false`.\n Since, for the positive integers, all common\n definitions of division are equal, this\n is exactly equal to `self.overflowing_div(rhs)`.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
