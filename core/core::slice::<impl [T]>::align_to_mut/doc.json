  "doc": " Transmutes the mutable slice to a mutable slice of another type, ensuring alignment of the\n types is maintained.\n\n This method splits the slice into three distinct slices: prefix, correctly aligned middle\n slice of a new type, and the suffix slice. The middle part will be as big as possible under\n the given alignment constraint and element size.\n\n This method has no purpose when either input element `T` or output element `U` are\n zero-sized and will return the original slice without splitting anything.\n\n # Safety\n\n This method is essentially a `transmute` with respect to the elements in the returned\n middle slice, so all the usual caveats pertaining to `transmute::<T, U>` also apply here.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n unsafe {\n     let mut bytes: [u8; 7] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];\n     let (prefix, shorts, suffix) = bytes.align_to_mut::<u16>();\n     // less_efficient_algorithm_for_bytes(prefix);\n     // more_efficient_algorithm_for_aligned_shorts(shorts);\n     // less_efficient_algorithm_for_bytes(suffix);\n }\n ```\n"
