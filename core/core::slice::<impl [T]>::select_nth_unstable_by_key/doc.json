  "doc": " Reorders the slice with a key extraction function such that the element at `index` is at a\n sort-order position. All elements before `index` will have keys `<=` to the key at `index`,\n and all elements after will have keys `>=` to it.\n\n This reordering is unstable (i.e. any element that compares equal to the nth element may end\n up at that position), in-place (i.e.  does not allocate), and runs in *O*(*n*) time. This\n function is also known as \"kth element\" in other libraries.\n\n Returns a triple partitioning the reordered slice:\n\n * The unsorted subslice before `index`, whose elements all satisfy `f(x) <= f(self[index])`.\n\n * The element at `index`.\n\n * The unsorted subslice after `index`, whose elements all satisfy `f(x) >= f(self[index])`.\n\n # Current implementation\n\n The current algorithm is an introselect implementation based on [ipnsort] by Lukas Bergdoll\n and Orson Peters, which is also the basis for [`sort_unstable`]. The fallback algorithm is\n Median of Medians using Tukey's Ninther for pivot selection, which guarantees linear runtime\n for all inputs.\n\n [`sort_unstable`]: slice::sort_unstable\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics when `index >= len()`, meaning it always panics on empty slices.\n\n May panic if `K: Ord` does not implement a total order.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut v = [-5i32, 4, 1, -3, 2];\n\n // Find the items `<=` to the absolute median, the absolute median itself, and the items\n // `>=` to it.\n let (lesser, median, greater) = v.select_nth_unstable_by_key(2, |a| a.abs());\n\n assert!(lesser == [1, 2] || lesser == [2, 1]);\n assert_eq!(median, &mut -3);\n assert!(greater == [4, -5] || greater == [-5, 4]);\n\n // We are only guaranteed the slice will be one of the following, based on the way we sort\n // about the specified index.\n assert!(v == [1, 2, -3, 4, -5] ||\n         v == [1, 2, -3, -5, 4] ||\n         v == [2, 1, -3, 4, -5] ||\n         v == [2, 1, -3, -5, 4]);\n ```\n\n [ipnsort]: https://github.com/Voultapher/sort-research-rs/tree/main/ipnsort\n [total order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order\n"
