  "doc": " Takes an output stream and an `Arguments` struct that can be precompiled with\n the `format_args!` macro.\n\n The arguments will be formatted according to the specified format string\n into the output stream provided.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::fmt;\n\n let mut output = String::new();\n fmt::write(&mut output, format_args!(\"Hello {}!\", \"world\"))\n     .expect(\"Error occurred while trying to write in String\");\n assert_eq!(output, \"Hello world!\");\n ```\n\n Please note that using [`write!`] might be preferable. Example:\n\n ```\n use std::fmt::Write;\n\n let mut output = String::new();\n write!(&mut output, \"Hello {}!\", \"world\")\n     .expect(\"Error occurred while trying to write in String\");\n assert_eq!(output, \"Hello world!\");\n ```\n\n [`write!`]: crate::write!\n"
