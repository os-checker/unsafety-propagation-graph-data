  "doc": " Returns a reference to a `LocalWaker` that does nothing when used.\n\n This is mostly useful for writing tests that need a [`Context`] to poll\n some futures, but are not expecting those futures to wake the waker or\n do not need to do anything specific if it happens.\n\n More generally, using `LocalWaker::noop()` to poll a future\n means discarding the notification of when the future should be polled again,\n So it should only be used when such a notification will not be needed to make progress.\n\n If an owned `LocalWaker` is needed, `clone()` this one.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(local_waker)]\n use std::future::Future;\n use std::task::{ContextBuilder, LocalWaker, Waker, Poll};\n\n let mut cx = ContextBuilder::from_waker(Waker::noop())\n     .local_waker(LocalWaker::noop())\n     .build();\n\n let mut future = Box::pin(async { 10 });\n assert_eq!(future.as_mut().poll(&mut cx), Poll::Ready(10));\n ```\n"
