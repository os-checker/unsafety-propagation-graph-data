  "doc": " Splits a `RefMut` into multiple `RefMut`s for different components of the\n borrowed data.\n\n The underlying `RefCell` will remain mutably borrowed until both\n returned `RefMut`s go out of scope.\n\n The `RefCell` is already mutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RefMut::map_split(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the\n same name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};\n\n let cell = RefCell::new([1, 2, 3, 4]);\n let borrow = cell.borrow_mut();\n let (mut begin, mut end) = RefMut::map_split(borrow, |slice| slice.split_at_mut(2));\n assert_eq!(*begin, [1, 2]);\n assert_eq!(*end, [3, 4]);\n begin.copy_from_slice(&[4, 3]);\n end.copy_from_slice(&[2, 1]);\n ```\n"
