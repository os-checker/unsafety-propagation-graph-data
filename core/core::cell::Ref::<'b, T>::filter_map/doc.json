  "doc": " Makes a new `Ref` for an optional component of the borrowed data. The\n original guard is returned as an `Err(..)` if the closure returns\n `None`.\n\n The `RefCell` is already immutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `Ref::filter_map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the same\n name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::{RefCell, Ref};\n\n let c = RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);\n let b1: Ref<'_, Vec<u32>> = c.borrow();\n let b2: Result<Ref<'_, u32>, _> = Ref::filter_map(b1, |v| v.get(1));\n assert_eq!(*b2.unwrap(), 2);\n ```\n"
