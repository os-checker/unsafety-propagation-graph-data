  "doc": " Calculates the distance between two pointers within the same allocation. The returned value is in\n units of **bytes**.\n\n This is purely a convenience for casting to a `u8` pointer and\n using [`offset_from`][NonNull::offset_from] on it. See that method for\n documentation and safety requirements.\n\n For non-`Sized` pointees this operation considers only the data pointers,\n ignoring the metadata.\n"
