These correspond to the success and failure orderings of\n respectively.\n\n Using [`Acquire`] as success ordering makes the store part\n of this operation [`Relaxed`], and using [`Release`] makes the final successful load\n [`Relaxed`]. The (failed) load ordering can only be [`SeqCst`], [`Acquire`] or [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic operations on\n\n # Considerations\n\n [CAS operation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap\n This method is not magic; it is not provided by the hardware, and does not act like a\n critical section or mutex.\n\n It is implemented on top of an atomic [compare-and-swap operation], and thus is subject to\n the usual drawbacks of CAS operations. In particular, be careful of the [ABA problem]\n if this atomic integer is an index or more generally if knowledge of only the *bitwise value*\n of the atomic is not in and of itself sufficient to ensure any required preconditions.\n\n [ABA Problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem\n [compare-and-swap operation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap\n\n # Examples\n\n ```rust\n #![feature(atomic_try_update)]\n\n assert_eq!(x.update(Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::SeqCst, |x| x + 1), 7);\n assert_eq!(x.update(Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::SeqCst, |x| x + 1), 8);\n assert_eq!(x.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 9);\n ```\n"
