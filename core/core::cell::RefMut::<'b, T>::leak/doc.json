  "doc": " Converts into a mutable reference to the underlying data.\n\n The underlying `RefCell` can not be borrowed from again and will always appear already\n mutably borrowed, making the returned reference the only to the interior.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RefMut::leak(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the\n same name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(cell_leak)]\n use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};\n let cell = RefCell::new(0);\n\n let value = RefMut::leak(cell.borrow_mut());\n assert_eq!(*value, 0);\n *value = 1;\n\n assert!(cell.try_borrow_mut().is_err());\n ```\n"
