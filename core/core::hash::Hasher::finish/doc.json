Additional [`write`]s will continue from the current value.\n If you need to start a fresh hash value, you will have to create\n a new hasher.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hasher};\n\n let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();\n hasher.write(b\"Cool!\");\n\n println!(\"Hash is {:x}!\", hasher.finish());\n ```\n\n [`write`]: Hasher::write\n"
