  "doc": " Adds a signed offset to a pointer using wrapping arithmetic.\n\n `count` is in units of T; e.g., a `count` of 3 represents a pointer\n offset of `3 * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n This operation itself is always safe, but using the resulting pointer is not.\n\n The resulting pointer \"remembers\" the [allocation] that `self` points to\n (this is called \"[Provenance](ptr/index.html#provenance)\").\n The pointer must not be used to read or write other allocations.\n\n In other words, `let z = x.wrapping_offset((y as isize) - (x as isize))` does *not* make `z`\n the same as `y` even if we assume `T` has size `1` and there is no overflow: `z` is still\n attached to the object `x` is attached to, and dereferencing it is Undefined Behavior unless\n `x` and `y` point into the same allocation.\n\n Compared to [`offset`], this method basically delays the requirement of staying within the\n same allocation: [`offset`] is immediate Undefined Behavior when crossing object\n boundaries; `wrapping_offset` produces a pointer but still leads to Undefined Behavior if a\n pointer is dereferenced when it is out-of-bounds of the object it is attached to. [`offset`]\n can be optimized better and is thus preferable in performance-sensitive code.\n\n The delayed check only considers the value of the pointer that was dereferenced, not the\n intermediate values used during the computation of the final result. For example,\n `x.wrapping_offset(o).wrapping_offset(o.wrapping_neg())` is always the same as `x`. In other\n words, leaving the allocation and then re-entering it later is permitted.\n\n [`offset`]: #method.offset\n [allocation]: crate::ptr#allocation\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n # use std::fmt::Write;\n // Iterate using a raw pointer in increments of two elements\n let data = [1u8, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n let mut ptr: *const u8 = data.as_ptr();\n let step = 2;\n let end_rounded_up = ptr.wrapping_offset(6);\n\n let mut out = String::new();\n while ptr != end_rounded_up {\n     unsafe {\n         write!(&mut out, \"{}, \", *ptr)?;\n     }\n     ptr = ptr.wrapping_offset(step);\n }\n assert_eq!(out.as_str(), \"1, 3, 5, \");\n # std::fmt::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n"
