  "doc": " Returns a mutable pointer to the underlying pointer.\n\n Doing non-atomic reads and writes on the resulting pointer can be a data race.\n This method is mostly useful for FFI, where the function signature may use\n `*mut *mut T` instead of `&AtomicPtr<T>`.\n\n Returning an `*mut` pointer from a shared reference to this atomic is safe because the\n atomic types work with interior mutability. All modifications of an atomic change the value\n through a shared reference, and can do so safely as long as they use atomic operations. Any\n use of the returned raw pointer requires an `unsafe` block and still has to uphold the\n requirements of the [memory model].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```ignore (extern-declaration)\n use std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr;\n\n extern \"C\" {\n     fn my_atomic_op(arg: *mut *mut u32);\n }\n\n let mut value = 17;\n let atomic = AtomicPtr::new(&mut value);\n\n // SAFETY: Safe as long as `my_atomic_op` is atomic.\n unsafe {\n     my_atomic_op(atomic.as_ptr());\n }\n ```\n\n [memory model]: self#memory-model-for-atomic-accesses\n"
