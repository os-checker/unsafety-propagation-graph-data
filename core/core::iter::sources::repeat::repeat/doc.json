  "doc": " Creates a new iterator that endlessly repeats a single element.\n\n The `repeat()` function repeats a single value over and over again.\n\n Infinite iterators like `repeat()` are often used with adapters like\n [`Iterator::take()`], in order to make them finite.\n\n If you know the number of repetitions in advance, consider using [`repeat_n()`]\n instead, as it is more efficient and conveys the intent more clearly.\n\n Use [`str::repeat()`] instead of this function if you just want to repeat\n a char/string `n` times.\n\n If the element type of the iterator you need does not implement `Clone`,\n or if you do not want to keep the repeated element in memory, you can\n instead use the [`repeat_with()`] function.\n\n [`repeat_n()`]: crate::iter::repeat_n\n [`repeat_with()`]: crate::iter::repeat_with\n [`str::repeat()`]: ../../std/primitive.str.html#method.repeat\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::iter;\n\n // the number four 4ever:\n let mut fours = iter::repeat(4);\n\n assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());\n\n // yup, still four\n assert_eq!(Some(4), fours.next());\n ```\n\n Going finite with [`Iterator::take()`]:\n\n ```\n use std::iter;\n\n // that last example was too many fours. Let's only have four fours.\n let mut four_fours = iter::repeat(4).take(4);\n\n assert_eq!(Some(4), four_fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), four_fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), four_fours.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), four_fours.next());\n\n // ... and now we're done\n assert_eq!(None, four_fours.next());\n ```\n"
