  "doc": " Returns the inner pointer to this C string.\n\n The returned pointer will be valid for as long as `self` is, and points\n to a contiguous region of memory terminated with a 0 byte to represent\n the end of the string.\n\n The type of the returned pointer is\n [`*const c_char`][crate::ffi::c_char], and whether it's\n an alias for `*const i8` or `*const u8` is platform-specific.\n\n **WARNING**\n\n The returned pointer is read-only; writing to it (including passing it\n to C code that writes to it) causes undefined behavior.\n\n It is your responsibility to make sure that the underlying memory is not\n freed too early. For example, the following code will cause undefined\n behavior when `ptr` is used inside the `unsafe` block:\n\n ```no_run\n # #![expect(dangling_pointers_from_temporaries)]\n use std::ffi::{CStr, CString};\n\n // 💀 The meaning of this entire program is undefined,\n // 💀 and nothing about its behavior is guaranteed,\n // 💀 not even that its behavior resembles the code as written,\n // 💀 just because it contains a single instance of undefined behavior!\n\n // 🚨 creates a dangling pointer to a temporary `CString`\n // 🚨 that is deallocated at the end of the statement\n let ptr = CString::new(\"Hi!\".to_uppercase()).unwrap().as_ptr();\n\n // without undefined behavior, you would expect that `ptr` equals:\n dbg!(CStr::from_bytes_with_nul(b\"HI!\\0\").unwrap());\n\n // 🙏 Possibly the program behaved as expected so far,\n // 🙏 and this just shows `ptr` is now garbage..., but\n // 💀 this violates `CStr::from_ptr`'s safety contract\n // 💀 leading to a dereference of a dangling pointer,\n // 💀 which is immediate undefined behavior.\n // 💀 *BOOM*, you're dead, your entire program has no meaning.\n dbg!(unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(ptr) });\n ```\n\n This happens because, the pointer returned by `as_ptr` does not carry any\n lifetime information, and the `CString` is deallocated immediately after\n the expression that it is part of has been evaluated.\n To fix the problem, bind the `CString` to a local variable:\n\n ```\n use std::ffi::{CStr, CString};\n\n let c_str = CString::new(\"Hi!\".to_uppercase()).unwrap();\n let ptr = c_str.as_ptr();\n\n assert_eq!(unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(ptr) }, c\"HI!\");\n ```\n"
