  "doc": " Returns `None` if the pointer is null, or else returns a unique reference to\n the value wrapped in `Some`. In contrast to [`as_mut`], this does not require\n that the value has to be initialized.\n\n For the shared counterpart see [`as_uninit_ref`].\n\n [`as_mut`]: #method.as_mut\n [`as_uninit_ref`]: pointer#method.as_uninit_ref-1\n\n # Safety\n\n When calling this method, you have to ensure that *either* the pointer is null *or*\n the pointer is [convertible to a reference](crate::ptr#pointer-to-reference-conversion).\n\n # Panics during const evaluation\n\n This method will panic during const evaluation if the pointer cannot be\n determined to be null or not. See [`is_null`] for more information.\n\n [`is_null`]: #method.is_null-1\n"
