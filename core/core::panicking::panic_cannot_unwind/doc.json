  "doc": " Panics because we cannot unwind out of a function.\n\n This is a separate function to avoid the codesize impact of each crate containing the string to\n pass to `panic_nounwind`.\n\n This function is called directly by the codegen backend, and must not have\n any extra arguments (including those synthesized by track_caller).\n"
