  "doc": " Tries to makes a new `RefMut` for a component of the borrowed data.\n On failure, the original guard is returned alongside with the error\n returned by the closure.\n\n The `RefCell` is already mutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RefMut::try_map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the same\n name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(refcell_try_map)]\n use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};\n use std::str::{from_utf8_mut, Utf8Error};\n\n let c = RefCell::new(vec![0x68, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F]);\n {\n     let b1: RefMut<'_, Vec<u8>> = c.borrow_mut();\n     let b2: Result<RefMut<'_, str>, _> = RefMut::try_map(b1, |v| from_utf8_mut(v));\n     let mut b2 = b2.unwrap();\n     assert_eq!(&*b2, \"hello\");\n     b2.make_ascii_uppercase();\n }\n assert_eq!(*c.borrow(), \"HELLO\".as_bytes());\n\n let c = RefCell::new(vec![0xFF]);\n let b1: RefMut<'_, Vec<u8>> = c.borrow_mut();\n let b2: Result<_, (RefMut<'_, Vec<u8>>, Utf8Error)> = RefMut::try_map(b1, |v| from_utf8_mut(v));\n let (b3, e) = b2.unwrap_err();\n assert_eq!(*b3, vec![0xFF]);\n assert_eq!(e.valid_up_to(), 0);\n ```\n"
