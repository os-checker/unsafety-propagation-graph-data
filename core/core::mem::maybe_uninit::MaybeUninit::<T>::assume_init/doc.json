  "doc": " Extracts the value from the `MaybeUninit<T>` container. This is a great way\n to ensure that the data will get dropped, because the resulting `T` is\n subject to the usual drop handling.\n\n # Safety\n\n It is up to the caller to guarantee that the `MaybeUninit<T>` really is in an initialized\n state. Calling this when the content is not yet fully initialized causes immediate undefined\n behavior. The [type-level documentation][inv] contains more information about\n this initialization invariant.\n\n [inv]: #initialization-invariant\n\n On top of that, remember that most types have additional invariants beyond merely\n being considered initialized at the type level. For example, a `1`-initialized [`Vec<T>`]\n is considered initialized (under the current implementation; this does not constitute\n a stable guarantee) because the only requirement the compiler knows about it\n is that the data pointer must be non-null. Creating such a `Vec<T>` does not cause\n *immediate* undefined behavior, but will cause undefined behavior with most\n safe operations (including dropping it).\n\n [`Vec<T>`]: ../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html\n\n # Examples\n\n Correct usage of this method:\n\n ```rust\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<bool>::uninit();\n x.write(true);\n let x_init = unsafe { x.assume_init() };\n assert_eq!(x_init, true);\n ```\n\n *Incorrect* usage of this method:\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let x = MaybeUninit::<Vec<u32>>::uninit();\n let x_init = unsafe { x.assume_init() };\n // `x` had not been initialized yet, so this last line caused undefined behavior. ⚠️\n ```\n"
