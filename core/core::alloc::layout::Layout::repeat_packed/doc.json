  "doc": " Creates a layout describing the record for `n` instances of\n `self`, with no padding between each instance.\n\n Note that, unlike `repeat`, `repeat_packed` does not guarantee\n that the repeated instances of `self` will be properly\n aligned, even if a given instance of `self` is properly\n aligned. In other words, if the layout returned by\n `repeat_packed` is used to allocate an array, it is not\n guaranteed that all elements in the array will be properly\n aligned.\n\n On arithmetic overflow, returns `LayoutError`.\n"
