  "doc": " Unwraps this `Pin<Ptr>`, returning the underlying pointer.\n\n Doing this operation safely requires that the data pointed at by this pinning pointer\n implements [`Unpin`] so that we can ignore the pinning invariants when unwrapping it.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::pin::Pin;\n\n let mut val: u8 = 5;\n let pinned: Pin<&mut u8> = Pin::new(&mut val);\n\n // Unwrap the pin to get the underlying mutable reference to the value. We can do\n // this because `val` doesn't care about being moved, so the `Pin` was just\n // a \"facade\" anyway.\n let r = Pin::into_inner(pinned);\n assert_eq!(*r, 5);\n ```\n"
