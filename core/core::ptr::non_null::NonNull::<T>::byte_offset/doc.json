  "doc": " Calculates the offset from a pointer in bytes.\n\n `count` is in units of **bytes**.\n\n This is purely a convenience for casting to a `u8` pointer and\n using [offset][pointer::offset] on it. See that method for documentation\n and safety requirements.\n\n For non-`Sized` pointees this operation changes only the data pointer,\n leaving the metadata untouched.\n"
