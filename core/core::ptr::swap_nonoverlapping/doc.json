  "doc": " Swaps `count * size_of::<T>()` bytes between the two regions of memory\n beginning at `x` and `y`. The two regions must *not* overlap.\n\n The operation is \"untyped\" in the sense that data may be uninitialized or otherwise violate the\n requirements of `T`. The initialization state is preserved exactly.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * Both `x` and `y` must be [valid] for both reads and writes of `count *\n   size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n * Both `x` and `y` must be properly aligned.\n\n * The region of memory beginning at `x` with a size of `count *\n   size_of::<T>()` bytes must *not* overlap with the region of memory\n   beginning at `y` with the same size.\n\n Note that even if the effectively copied size (`count * size_of::<T>()`) is `0`,\n the pointers must be properly aligned.\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let mut x = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n let mut y = [7, 8, 9];\n\n unsafe {\n     ptr::swap_nonoverlapping(x.as_mut_ptr(), y.as_mut_ptr(), 2);\n }\n\n assert_eq!(x, [7, 8, 3, 4]);\n assert_eq!(y, [1, 2, 9]);\n ```\n"
