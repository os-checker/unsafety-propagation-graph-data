  "doc": " Parse 8 digits, loaded as bytes in little-endian order.\n\n This uses the trick where every digit is in [0x030, 0x39],\n and therefore can be parsed in 3 multiplications, much\n faster than the normal 8.\n\n This is based off the algorithm described in \"Fast numeric string to\n int\", available here: <https://johnnylee-sde.github.io/Fast-numeric-string-to-int/>.\n"
