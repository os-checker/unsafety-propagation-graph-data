  "doc": " This function returns a function that lets you index the given array in const.\n As implemented it can optimize better than iterators, and can be constified.\n It acts like a sort of guard (owns the array) and iterator combined, which can be implemented\n as it is a struct that implements const fn;\n in that regard it is somewhat similar to an array::Iter implementing `UncheckedIterator`.\n The only method you're really allowed to call is `next()`,\n anything else is more or less UB, hence this function being unsafe.\n Moved elements will not be dropped.\n This will also not actually store the array.\n\n SAFETY: must only be called `N` times. Thou shalt not drop the array either.\n"
