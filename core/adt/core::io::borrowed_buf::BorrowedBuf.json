  "doc_adt": " A borrowed buffer of initially uninitialized bytes, which is incrementally filled.\n\n This type makes it safer to work with `MaybeUninit` buffers, such as to read into a buffer\n without having to initialize it first. It tracks the region of bytes that have been filled and\n the region that remains uninitialized.\n\n The contents of the buffer can be visualized as:\n ```not_rust\n [                         capacity                            ]\n [ len: filled and initialized | capacity - len: uninitialized ]\n ```\n\n Note that `BorrowedBuf` does not distinguish between uninitialized data and data that was\n previously initialized but no longer contains valid data.\n\n A `BorrowedBuf` is created around some existing data (or capacity for data) via a unique\n reference (`&mut`). The `BorrowedBuf` can be configured (e.g., using `clear` or `set_len`), but\n cannot be directly written. To write into the buffer, use `unfilled` to create a\n `BorrowedCursor`. The cursor has write-only access to the unfilled portion of the buffer.\n\n The lifetime `'data` is a bound on the lifetime of the underlying data.\n",
