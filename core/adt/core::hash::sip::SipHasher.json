This lets you key your hash tables from a strong RNG, such as\n [`rand::os::OsRng`](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/rngs/struct.OsRng.html).\n\n Although the SipHash algorithm is considered to be generally strong,\n it is not intended for cryptographic purposes. As such, all\n cryptographic uses of this implementation are _strongly discouraged_.\n",
