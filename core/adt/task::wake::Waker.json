  "doc_adt": " A `Waker` is a handle for waking up a task by notifying its executor that it\n is ready to be run.\n\n This handle encapsulates a [`RawWaker`] instance, which defines the\n executor-specific wakeup behavior.\n\n The typical life of a `Waker` is that it is constructed by an executor, wrapped in a\n [`Context`], then passed to [`Future::poll()`]. Then, if the future chooses to return\n [`Poll::Pending`], it must also store the waker somehow and call [`Waker::wake()`] when\n the future should be polled again.\n\n Implements [`Clone`], [`Send`], and [`Sync`]; therefore, a waker may be invoked\n from any thread, including ones not in any way managed by the executor. For example,\n this might be done to wake a future when a blocking function call completes on another\n thread.\n\n Note that it is preferable to use `waker.clone_from(&new_waker)` instead\n of `*waker = new_waker.clone()`, as the former will avoid cloning the waker\n unnecessarily if the two wakers [wake the same task](Self::will_wake).\n\n Constructing a `Waker` from a [`RawWaker`] is unsafe.\n Implementing the [`Wake`] trait is a safe alternative that requires memory allocation.\n\n [`Future::poll()`]: core::future::Future::poll\n [`Poll::Pending`]: core::task::Poll::Pending\n [`Wake`]: ../../alloc/task/trait.Wake.html\n",
