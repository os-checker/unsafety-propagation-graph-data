  "doc_adt": " An unbounded range (`..`).\n\n `RangeFull` is primarily used as a [slicing index], its shorthand is `..`.\n It cannot serve as an [`Iterator`] because it doesn't have a starting point.\n\n # Examples\n\n The `..` syntax is a `RangeFull`:\n\n ```\n assert_eq!(.., std::ops::RangeFull);\n ```\n\n It does not have an [`IntoIterator`] implementation, so you can't use it in\n a `for` loop directly. This won't compile:\n\n ```compile_fail,E0277\n for i in .. {\n     // ...\n }\n ```\n\n Used as a [slicing index], `RangeFull` produces the full array as a slice.\n\n ```\n let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];\n assert_eq!(arr[ ..  ], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]); // This is the `RangeFull`\n assert_eq!(arr[ .. 3], [0, 1, 2      ]);\n assert_eq!(arr[ ..=3], [0, 1, 2, 3   ]);\n assert_eq!(arr[1..  ], [   1, 2, 3, 4]);\n assert_eq!(arr[1.. 3], [   1, 2      ]);\n assert_eq!(arr[1..=3], [   1, 2, 3   ]);\n ```\n\n [slicing index]: crate::slice::SliceIndex\n",
