In the\n indirect case, the caller must call [`advance`](BorrowedCursor::advance) after writing to inform\n the cursor how many bytes have been written.\n\n Once data is written to the cursor, it becomes part of the filled portion of the underlying\n `BorrowedBuf` and can no longer be accessed or re-written by the cursor. I.e., the cursor tracks\n the unfilled part of the underlying `BorrowedBuf`.\n\n The lifetime `'a` is a bound on the lifetime of the underlying buffer (which means it is a bound\n on the data in that buffer by transitivity).\n",
