Calling one of the contained functions using\n any other `data` pointer will cause undefined behavior.\n\n Note that while this type implements `PartialEq`, comparing function pointers, and hence\n comparing structs like this that contain function pointers, is unreliable: pointers to the same\n function can compare inequal (because functions are duplicated in multiple codegen units), and\n pointers to *different* functions can compare equal (since identical functions can be\n deduplicated within a codegen unit).\n\n # Thread safety\n If the [`RawWaker`] will be used to construct a [`Waker`] then\n these functions must all be thread-safe (even though [`RawWaker`] is\n <code>\\![Send] + \\![Sync]</code>). This is because [`Waker`] is <code>[Send] + [Sync]</code>,\n and it may be moved to arbitrary threads or invoked by `&` reference. For example,\n this means that if the `clone` and `drop` functions manage a reference count,\n they must do so atomically.\n\n However, if the [`RawWaker`] will be used to construct a [`LocalWaker`] instead, then\n these functions don't need to be thread safe. This means that <code>\\![Send] + \\![Sync]</code>\n  data can be stored in the data pointer, and reference counting does not need any atomic\n synchronization. This is because [`LocalWaker`] is not thread safe itself, so it cannot\n be sent across threads.\n",
