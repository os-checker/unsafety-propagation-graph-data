  "doc": " Panic-free bitwise shift-left; yields `self << mask(rhs)`, where `mask` removes\n any high-order bits of `rhs` that would cause the shift to exceed the bitwidth of the type.\n\n Note that this is *not* the same as a rotate-left; the RHS of a wrapping shift-left is restricted to\n the range of the type, rather than the bits shifted out of the LHS being returned to the other end.\n The primitive integer types all implement a [`rotate_left`](Self::rotate_left) function,\n which may be what you want instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
