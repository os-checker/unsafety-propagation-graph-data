  "doc": " The `prefetch` intrinsic is a hint to the code generator to insert a prefetch instruction\n for the given address if supported; otherwise, it is a no-op.\n Prefetches have no effect on the behavior of the program but can change its performance\n characteristics.\n\n The `LOCALITY` argument is a temporal locality specifier ranging from (0) - no locality,\n to (3) - extremely local keep in cache.\n\n This intrinsic does not have a stable counterpart.\n"
