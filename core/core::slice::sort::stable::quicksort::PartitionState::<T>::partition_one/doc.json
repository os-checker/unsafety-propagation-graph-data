  "doc": " Depending on the value of `towards_left` this function will write a value\n to the growing left or right side of the scratch memory. This forms the\n branchless core of the partition.\n\n # Safety\n\n This function may be called at most `len` times. If it is called exactly\n `len` times the scratch buffer then contains a copy of each element from\n the scan buffer exactly once - a permutation, and num_left <= len.\n"
