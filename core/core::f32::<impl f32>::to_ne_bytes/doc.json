  "doc": " Returns the memory representation of this floating point number as a byte array in\n native byte order.\n\n As the target platform's native endianness is used, portable code\n should use [`to_be_bytes`] or [`to_le_bytes`], as appropriate, instead.\n\n [`to_be_bytes`]: f32::to_be_bytes\n [`to_le_bytes`]: f32::to_le_bytes\n\n See [`from_bits`](Self::from_bits) for some discussion of the\n portability of this operation (there are almost no issues).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let bytes = 12.5f32.to_ne_bytes();\n assert_eq!(\n     bytes,\n     if cfg!(target_endian = \"big\") {\n         [0x41, 0x48, 0x00, 0x00]\n     } else {\n         [0x00, 0x00, 0x48, 0x41]\n     }\n );\n ```\n"
