  "doc": " Optimized ASCII test that will use usize-at-a-time operations instead of\n byte-at-a-time operations (when possible).\n\n The algorithm we use here is pretty simple. If `s` is too short, we just\n check each byte and be done with it. Otherwise:\n\n - Read the first word with an unaligned load.\n - Align the pointer, read subsequent words until end with aligned loads.\n - Read the last `usize` from `s` with an unaligned load.\n\n If any of these loads produces something for which `contains_nonascii`\n (above) returns true, then we know the answer is false.\n"
