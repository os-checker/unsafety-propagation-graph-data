  "doc": " Computes `a + b`, saturating at numeric bounds.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n\n The stabilized versions of this intrinsic are available on the integer\n primitives via the `saturating_add` method. For example,\n [`u32::saturating_add`]\n"
