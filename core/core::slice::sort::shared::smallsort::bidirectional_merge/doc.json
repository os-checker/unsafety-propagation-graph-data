  "doc": " Merge v assuming v[..len / 2] and v[len / 2..] are sorted.\n\n Original idea for bi-directional merging by Igor van den Hoven (quadsort),\n adapted to only use merge up and down. In contrast to the original\n parity_merge function, it performs 2 writes instead of 4 per iteration.\n\n # Safety\n The caller must guarantee that `dst` is valid for v.len() writes.\n Also `v.as_ptr()` and `dst` must not alias and v.len() must be >= 2.\n\n Note that T must be Freeze, the comparison function is evaluated on outdated\n temporary 'copies' that may not end up in the final array.\n"
