  "doc": " Wakes up the task associated with this `LocalWaker`.\n\n As long as the executor keeps running and the task is not finished, it is\n guaranteed that each invocation of [`wake()`](Self::wake) (or\n [`wake_by_ref()`](Self::wake_by_ref)) will be followed by at least one\n [`poll()`] of the task to which this `LocalWaker` belongs. This makes\n it possible to temporarily yield to other tasks while running potentially\n unbounded processing loops.\n\n Note that the above implies that multiple wake-ups may be coalesced into a\n single [`poll()`] invocation by the runtime.\n\n Also note that yielding to competing tasks is not guaranteed: it is the\n executor’s choice which task to run and the executor may choose to run the\n current task again.\n\n [`poll()`]: crate::future::Future::poll\n"
