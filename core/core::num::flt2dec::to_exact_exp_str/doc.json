  "doc": " Formats given floating point number into the exponential form with\n exactly given number of significant digits. The result is stored to\n the supplied parts array while utilizing given byte buffer as a scratch.\n `upper` is used to determine the case of the exponent prefix (`e` or `E`).\n The first part to be rendered is always a `Part::Sign` (which can be\n an empty string if no sign is rendered).\n\n `format_exact` should be the underlying digit-generation function.\n It should return the part of the buffer that it initialized.\n You probably would want `strategy::grisu::format_exact` for this.\n\n The byte buffer should be at least `ndigits` bytes long unless `ndigits` is\n so large that only the fixed number of digits will be ever written.\n (The tipping point for `f64` is about 800, so 1000 bytes should be enough.)\n There should be at least 6 parts available, due to the worst case like\n `[+][1][.][2345][e][-][6]`.\n"
