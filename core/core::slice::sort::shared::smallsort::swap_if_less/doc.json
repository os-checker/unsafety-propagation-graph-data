  "doc": " Swap two values in the slice pointed to by `v_base` at the position `a_pos` and `b_pos` if the\n value at position `b_pos` is less than the one at position `a_pos`.\n\n Purposefully not marked `#[inline]`, despite us wanting it to be inlined for integers like\n types. `is_less` could be a huge function and we want to give the compiler an option to\n not inline this function. For the same reasons that this function is very perf critical\n it should be in the same module as the functions that use it.\n"
