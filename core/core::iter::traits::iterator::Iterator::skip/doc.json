  "doc": " Creates an iterator that skips the first `n` elements.\n\n `skip(n)` skips elements until `n` elements are skipped or the end of the\n iterator is reached (whichever happens first). After that, all the remaining\n elements are yielded. In particular, if the original iterator is too short,\n then the returned iterator is empty.\n\n Rather than overriding this method directly, instead override the `nth` method.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().skip(2);\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n"
