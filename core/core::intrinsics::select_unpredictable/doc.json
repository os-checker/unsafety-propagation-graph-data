  "doc": " Returns either `true_val` or `false_val` depending on condition `b` with a\n hint to the compiler that this condition is unlikely to be correctly\n predicted by a CPU's branch predictor (e.g. a binary search).\n\n This is otherwise functionally equivalent to `if b { true_val } else { false_val }`.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n\n The public form of this intrinsic is [`core::hint::select_unpredictable`].\n However unlike the public form, the intrinsic will not drop the value that\n is not selected.\n"
