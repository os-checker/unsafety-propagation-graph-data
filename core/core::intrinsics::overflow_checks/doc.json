  "doc": " Returns whether we should perform some overflow-checking at runtime. This eventually evaluates to\n `cfg!(overflow_checks)`, but behaves different from `cfg!` when mixing crates built with different\n flags: if the crate has overflow checks enabled or carries the `#[rustc_inherit_overflow_checks]`\n attribute, evaluation is delayed until monomorphization (or until the call gets inlined into\n a crate that does not delay evaluation further); otherwise it can happen any time.\n\n The common case here is a user program built with overflow_checks linked against the distributed\n sysroot which is built without overflow_checks but with `#[rustc_inherit_overflow_checks]`.\n For code that gets monomorphized in the user crate (i.e., generic functions and functions with\n `#[inline]`), gating assertions on `overflow_checks()` rather than `cfg!(overflow_checks)` means that\n assertions are enabled whenever the *user crate* has overflow checks enabled. However if the\n user has overflow checks disabled, the checks will still get optimized out.\n"
