  "doc": " Collects all the items from an iterator into a collection.\n\n This method consumes the iterator and adds all its items to the\n passed collection. The collection is then returned, so the call chain\n can be continued.\n\n This is useful when you already have a collection and want to add\n the iterator items to it.\n\n This method is a convenience method to call [Extend::extend](trait.Extend.html),\n but instead of being called on a collection, it's called on an iterator.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n #![feature(iter_collect_into)]\n\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut vec: Vec::<i32> = vec![0, 1];\n\n a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect_into(&mut vec);\n a.iter().map(|x| x * 10).collect_into(&mut vec);\n\n assert_eq!(vec, vec![0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 20, 30]);\n ```\n\n `Vec` can have a manual set capacity to avoid reallocating it:\n\n ```\n #![feature(iter_collect_into)]\n\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut vec: Vec::<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(6);\n\n a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect_into(&mut vec);\n a.iter().map(|x| x * 10).collect_into(&mut vec);\n\n assert_eq!(6, vec.capacity());\n assert_eq!(vec, vec![2, 4, 6, 10, 20, 30]);\n ```\n\n The returned mutable reference can be used to continue the call chain:\n\n ```\n #![feature(iter_collect_into)]\n\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut vec: Vec::<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(6);\n\n let count = a.iter().collect_into(&mut vec).iter().count();\n\n assert_eq!(count, vec.len());\n assert_eq!(vec, vec![1, 2, 3]);\n\n let count = a.iter().collect_into(&mut vec).iter().count();\n\n assert_eq!(count, vec.len());\n assert_eq!(vec, vec![1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]);\n ```\n"
