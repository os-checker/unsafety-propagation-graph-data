  "doc": " Calculates the remainder `self.rem_euclid(rhs)` as if by Euclidean division.\n\n Returns a tuple of the modulo after dividing along with a boolean\n indicating whether an arithmetic overflow would occur. Note that for\n unsigned integers overflow never occurs, so the second value is\n always `false`.\n Since, for the positive integers, all common\n definitions of division are equal, this operation\n is exactly equal to `self.overflowing_rem(rhs)`.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
