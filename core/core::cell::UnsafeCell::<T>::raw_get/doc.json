  "doc": " Gets a mutable pointer to the wrapped value.\n The difference from [`get`] is that this function accepts a raw pointer,\n which is useful to avoid the creation of temporary references.\n\n This can be cast to a pointer of any kind. When creating references, you must uphold the\n aliasing rules; see [the type-level docs][UnsafeCell#aliasing-rules] for more discussion and\n caveats.\n\n [`get`]: UnsafeCell::get()\n\n # Examples\n\n Gradual initialization of an `UnsafeCell` requires `raw_get`, as\n calling `get` would require creating a reference to uninitialized data:\n\n ```\n use std::cell::UnsafeCell;\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let m = MaybeUninit::<UnsafeCell<i32>>::uninit();\n unsafe { UnsafeCell::raw_get(m.as_ptr()).write(5); }\n // avoid below which references to uninitialized data\n // unsafe { UnsafeCell::get(&*m.as_ptr()).write(5); }\n let uc = unsafe { m.assume_init() };\n\n assert_eq!(uc.into_inner(), 5);\n ```\n"
