Computes `-self`, wrapping around at the boundary\n of the type.\n\n The only case where such wrapping can occur is when one negates `MIN` on a signed type (where `MIN`\n is the negative minimal value for the type); this is a positive value that is too large to represent\n in the type. In such a case, this function returns `MIN` itself.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
