  "doc": " Performs a bitwise \"or\" operation on the address of the current pointer,\n and the argument `val`, and stores a pointer with provenance of the\n current pointer and the resulting address.\n\n This is equivalent to using [`map_addr`] to atomically perform\n `ptr = ptr.map_addr(|a| a | val)`. This can be used in tagged\n pointer schemes to atomically set tag bits.\n\n **Caveat**: This operation returns the previous value. To compute the\n stored value without losing provenance, you may use [`map_addr`]. For\n example: `a.fetch_or(val).map_addr(|a| a | val)`.\n\n `fetch_or` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory\n ordering of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that\n using [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`],\n and using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on [`AtomicPtr`].\n\n This API and its claimed semantics are part of the Strict Provenance\n experiment, see the [module documentation for `ptr`][crate::ptr] for\n details.\n\n [`map_addr`]: pointer::map_addr\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering};\n\n let pointer = &mut 3i64 as *mut i64;\n\n let atom = AtomicPtr::<i64>::new(pointer);\n // Tag the bottom bit of the pointer.\n assert_eq!(atom.fetch_or(1, Ordering::Relaxed).addr() & 1, 0);\n // Extract and untag.\n let tagged = atom.load(Ordering::Relaxed);\n assert_eq!(tagged.addr() & 1, 1);\n assert_eq!(tagged.map_addr(|p| p & !1), pointer);\n ```\n"
