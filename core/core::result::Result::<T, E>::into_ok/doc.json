  "doc": " Returns the contained [`Ok`] value, but never panics.\n\n Unlike [`unwrap`], this method is known to never panic on the\n result types it is implemented for. Therefore, it can be used\n instead of `unwrap` as a maintainability safeguard that will fail\n to compile if the error type of the `Result` is later changed\n to an error that can actually occur.\n\n [`unwrap`]: Result::unwrap\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n # #![feature(never_type)]\n # #![feature(unwrap_infallible)]\n\n fn only_good_news() -> Result<String, !> {\n     Ok(\"this is fine\".into())\n }\n\n let s: String = only_good_news().into_ok();\n println!(\"{s}\");\n ```\n"
