  "doc": " Panic-free bitwise shift-right; yields `self >> mask(rhs)`,\n where `mask` removes any high-order bits of `rhs` that\n would cause the shift to exceed the bitwidth of the type.\n\n Note that this is *not* the same as a rotate-right; the\n RHS of a wrapping shift-right is restricted to the range\n of the type, rather than the bits shifted out of the LHS\n being returned to the other end. The primitive integer\n types all implement a [`rotate_right`](Self::rotate_right) function,\n which may be what you want instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
