  "doc": " Truncates an integer vector to a bitmask.\n\n `T` must be an integer vector.\n\n `U` must be either the smallest unsigned integer with at least as many bits as the length\n of `T`, or the smallest array of `u8` with at least as many bits as the length of `T`.\n\n Each element is truncated to a single bit and packed into the result.\n\n No matter whether the output is an array or an unsigned integer, it is treated as a single\n contiguous list of bits. The bitmask is always packed on the least-significant side of the\n output, and padded with 0s in the most-significant bits. The order of the bits depends on\n endianness:\n\n * On little endian, the least significant bit corresponds to the first vector element.\n * On big endian, the least significant bit corresponds to the last vector element.\n\n For example, `[!0, 0, !0, !0]` packs to\n - `0b1101u8` or `[0b1101]` on little endian, and\n - `0b1011u8` or `[0b1011]` on big endian.\n\n To consider a larger example,\n `[!0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, !0, !0, 0, 0, 0, 0, !0, 0]` packs to\n - `0b0100001100000001u16` or `[0b00000001, 0b01000011]` on little endian, and\n - `0b1000000011000010u16` or `[0b10000000, 0b11000010]` on big endian.\n\n And finally, a non-power-of-2 example with multiple bytes:\n `[!0, !0, 0, !0, 0, 0, !0, 0, !0, 0]` packs to\n - `0b0101001011u16` or `[0b01001011, 0b01]` on little endian, and\n - `0b1101001010u16` or `[0b11, 0b01001010]` on big endian.\n\n # Safety\n `x` must contain only `0` and `!0`.\n"
