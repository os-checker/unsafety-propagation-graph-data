  "doc": " Behaves like `alloc`, but also ensures that the contents\n are set to zero before being returned.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller has to ensure that `layout` has non-zero size. Like `alloc`\n zero sized `layout` will result in undefined behavior.\n However the allocated block of memory is guaranteed to be initialized.\n\n # Errors\n\n Returning a null pointer indicates that either memory is exhausted\n or `layout` does not meet allocator's size or alignment constraints,\n just as in `alloc`.\n\n Clients wishing to abort computation in response to an\n allocation error are encouraged to call the [`handle_alloc_error`] function,\n rather than directly invoking `panic!` or similar.\n\n [`handle_alloc_error`]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html\n"
