  "doc": " Advances the iterator from the back by `n` elements.\n\n `advance_back_by` is the reverse version of [`advance_by`]. This method will\n eagerly skip `n` elements starting from the back by calling [`next_back`] up\n to `n` times until [`None`] is encountered.\n\n `advance_back_by(n)` will return `Ok(())` if the iterator successfully advances by\n `n` elements, or a `Err(NonZero<usize>)` with value `k` if [`None`] is encountered, where `k`\n is remaining number of steps that could not be advanced because the iterator ran out.\n If `self` is empty and `n` is non-zero, then this returns `Err(n)`.\n Otherwise, `k` is always less than `n`.\n\n Calling `advance_back_by(0)` can do meaningful work, for example [`Flatten`] can advance its\n outer iterator until it finds an inner iterator that is not empty, which then often\n allows it to return a more accurate `size_hint()` than in its initial state.\n\n [`advance_by`]: Iterator::advance_by\n [`Flatten`]: crate::iter::Flatten\n [`next_back`]: DoubleEndedIterator::next_back\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n #![feature(iter_advance_by)]\n\n use std::num::NonZero;\n\n let a = [3, 4, 5, 6];\n let mut iter = a.iter();\n\n assert_eq!(iter.advance_back_by(2), Ok(()));\n assert_eq!(iter.next_back(), Some(&4));\n assert_eq!(iter.advance_back_by(0), Ok(()));\n assert_eq!(iter.advance_back_by(100), Err(NonZero::new(99).unwrap())); // only `&3` was skipped\n ```\n\n [`Ok(())`]: Ok\n [`Err(k)`]: Err\n"
