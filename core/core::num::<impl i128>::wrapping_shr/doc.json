  "doc": " Panic-free bitwise shift-right; yields `self >> mask(rhs)`, where `mask`\n removes any high-order bits of `rhs` that would cause the shift to exceed the bitwidth of the type.\n\n Note that this is *not* the same as a rotate-right; the RHS of a wrapping shift-right is restricted\n to the range of the type, rather than the bits shifted out of the LHS being returned to the other\n end. The primitive integer types all implement a [`rotate_right`](Self::rotate_right) function,\n which may be what you want instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n assert_eq!((-128i16).wrapping_shr(64), -128);\n ```\n"
