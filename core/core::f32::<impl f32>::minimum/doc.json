  "doc": " Returns the minimum of the two numbers, propagating NaN.\n\n If at least one of the arguments is NaN, the return value is NaN, with the bit pattern\n picked using the usual [rules for arithmetic operations](f32#nan-bit-patterns). Furthermore,\n `-0.0` is considered to be less than `+0.0`, making this function fully deterministic for\n non-NaN inputs.\n\n This is in contrast to [`f32::min`] which only returns NaN when *both* arguments are NaN,\n and which does not reliably order `-0.0` and `+0.0`.\n\n This follows the IEEE 754-2019 semantics for `minimum`.\n\n ```\n #![feature(float_minimum_maximum)]\n let x = 1.0f32;\n let y = 2.0f32;\n\n assert_eq!(x.minimum(y), x);\n assert!(x.minimum(f32::NAN).is_nan());\n ```\n"
