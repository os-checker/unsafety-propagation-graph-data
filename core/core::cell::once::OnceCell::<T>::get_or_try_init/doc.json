If the cell was uninitialized\n and `f()` failed, an error is returned.\n\n # Panics\n\n If `f()` panics, the panic is propagated to the caller, and the cell\n remains uninitialized.\n\n It is an error to reentrantly initialize the cell from `f`. Doing\n so results in a panic.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(once_cell_try)]\n\n use std::cell::OnceCell;\n\n let cell = OnceCell::new();\n assert_eq!(cell.get_or_try_init(|| Err(())), Err(()));\n assert!(cell.get().is_none());\n let value = cell.get_or_try_init(|| -> Result<i32, ()> {\n     Ok(92)\n });\n assert_eq!(value, Ok(&92));\n assert_eq!(cell.get(), Some(&92))\n ```\n"
