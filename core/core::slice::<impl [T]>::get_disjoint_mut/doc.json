  "doc": " Returns mutable references to many indices at once.\n\n An index can be either a `usize`, a [`Range`] or a [`RangeInclusive`]. Note\n that this method takes an array, so all indices must be of the same type.\n If passed an array of `usize`s this method gives back an array of mutable references\n to single elements, while if passed an array of ranges it gives back an array of\n mutable references to slices.\n\n Returns an error if any index is out-of-bounds, or if there are overlapping indices.\n An empty range is not considered to overlap if it is located at the beginning or at\n the end of another range, but is considered to overlap if it is located in the middle.\n\n This method does a O(n^2) check to check that there are no overlapping indices, so be careful\n when passing many indices.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let v = &mut [1, 2, 3];\n if let Ok([a, b]) = v.get_disjoint_mut([0, 2]) {\n     *a = 413;\n     *b = 612;\n }\n assert_eq!(v, &[413, 2, 612]);\n\n if let Ok([a, b]) = v.get_disjoint_mut([0..1, 1..3]) {\n     a[0] = 8;\n     b[0] = 88;\n     b[1] = 888;\n }\n assert_eq!(v, &[8, 88, 888]);\n\n if let Ok([a, b]) = v.get_disjoint_mut([1..=2, 0..=0]) {\n     a[0] = 11;\n     a[1] = 111;\n     b[0] = 1;\n }\n assert_eq!(v, &[1, 11, 111]);\n ```\n"
