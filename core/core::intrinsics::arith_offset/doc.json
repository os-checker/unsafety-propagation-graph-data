  "doc": " Calculates the offset from a pointer, potentially wrapping.\n\n This is implemented as an intrinsic to avoid converting to and from an\n integer, since the conversion inhibits certain optimizations.\n\n # Safety\n\n Unlike the `offset` intrinsic, this intrinsic does not restrict the\n resulting pointer to point into or at the end of an allocated\n object, and it wraps with two's complement arithmetic. The resulting\n value is not necessarily valid to be used to actually access memory.\n\n The stabilized version of this intrinsic is [`pointer::wrapping_offset`].\n"
