If you cannot guarantee that this\n will not overflow, use `backward` or `backward_checked` instead.\n\n # Invariants\n\n For any `a`:\n\n * if there exists `b` such that `b < a`, it is safe to call `Step::backward_unchecked(a, 1)`\n * if there exists `b`, `n` such that `steps_between(&b, &a) == (n, Some(n))`,\n   it is safe to call `Step::backward_unchecked(a, m)` for any `m <= n`.\n   * Corollary: `Step::backward_unchecked(a, 0)` is always safe.\n\n For any `a` and `n`, where no overflow occurs:\n\n * `Step::backward_unchecked(a, n)` is equivalent to `Step::backward(a, n)`\n"
