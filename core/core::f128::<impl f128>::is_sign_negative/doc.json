  "doc": " Returns `true` if `self` has a negative sign, including `-0.0`, NaNs with\n negative sign bit and negative infinity.\n\n Note that IEEE 754 doesn't assign any meaning to the sign bit in case of\n a NaN, and as Rust doesn't guarantee that the bit pattern of NaNs are\n conserved over arithmetic operations, the result of `is_sign_negative` on\n a NaN might produce an unexpected or non-portable result. See the [specification\n of NaN bit patterns](f32#nan-bit-patterns) for more info. Use `self.signum() == -1.0`\n if you need fully portable behavior (will return `false` for all NaNs).\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n\n let f = 7.0_f128;\n let g = -7.0_f128;\n\n assert!(!f.is_sign_negative());\n assert!(g.is_sign_negative());\n ```\n"
