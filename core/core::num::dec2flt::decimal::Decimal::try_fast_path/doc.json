  "doc": " Try turning the decimal into an exact float representation, using machine-sized integers\n and floats.\n\n This is extracted into a separate function so that it can be attempted before constructing\n a Decimal. This only works if both the mantissa and the exponent\n can be exactly represented as a machine float, since IEE-754 guarantees\n no rounding will occur.\n\n There is an exception: disguised fast-path cases, where we can shift\n powers-of-10 from the exponent to the significant digits.\n"
