  "doc": " Moves `src` into the pointed `dst`, returning the previous `dst` value.\n\n Neither value is dropped.\n\n This function is semantically equivalent to [`mem::replace`] except that it\n operates on raw pointers instead of references. When references are\n available, [`mem::replace`] should be preferred.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `dst` must be [valid] for both reads and writes.\n\n * `dst` must be properly aligned.\n\n * `dst` must point to a properly initialized value of type `T`.\n\n Note that even if `T` has size `0`, the pointer must be properly aligned.\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let mut rust = vec!['b', 'u', 's', 't'];\n\n // `mem::replace` would have the same effect without requiring the unsafe\n // block.\n let b = unsafe {\n     ptr::replace(&mut rust[0], 'r')\n };\n\n assert_eq!(b, 'b');\n assert_eq!(rust, &['r', 'u', 's', 't']);\n ```\n"
