  "doc": " Finds the closest `x` not exceeding `index` where [`is_char_boundary(x)`] is `true`.\n\n This method can help you truncate a string so that it's still valid UTF-8, but doesn't\n exceed a given number of bytes. Note that this is done purely at the character level\n and can still visually split graphemes, even though the underlying characters aren't\n split. For example, the emoji 🧑‍🔬 (scientist) could be split so that the string only\n includes 🧑 (person) instead.\n\n [`is_char_boundary(x)`]: Self::is_char_boundary\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s = \"❤️🧡💛💚💙💜\";\n assert_eq!(s.len(), 26);\n assert!(!s.is_char_boundary(13));\n\n let closest = s.floor_char_boundary(13);\n assert_eq!(closest, 10);\n assert_eq!(&s[..closest], \"❤️🧡\");\n ```\n"
