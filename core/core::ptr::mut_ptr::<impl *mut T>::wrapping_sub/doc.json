  "doc": " Subtracts an unsigned offset from a pointer using wrapping arithmetic.\n\n `count` is in units of T; e.g., a `count` of 3 represents a pointer\n offset of `3 * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n This operation itself is always safe, but using the resulting pointer is not.\n\n The resulting pointer \"remembers\" the [allocation] that `self` points to; it must not\n be used to read or write other allocations.\n\n In other words, `let z = x.wrapping_sub((x as usize) - (y as usize))` does *not* make `z`\n the same as `y` even if we assume `T` has size `1` and there is no overflow: `z` is still\n attached to the object `x` is attached to, and dereferencing it is Undefined Behavior unless\n `x` and `y` point into the same allocation.\n\n Compared to [`sub`], this method basically delays the requirement of staying within the\n same allocation: [`sub`] is immediate Undefined Behavior when crossing object\n boundaries; `wrapping_sub` produces a pointer but still leads to Undefined Behavior if a\n pointer is dereferenced when it is out-of-bounds of the object it is attached to. [`sub`]\n can be optimized better and is thus preferable in performance-sensitive code.\n\n The delayed check only considers the value of the pointer that was dereferenced, not the\n intermediate values used during the computation of the final result. For example,\n `x.wrapping_add(o).wrapping_sub(o)` is always the same as `x`. In other words, leaving the\n allocation and then re-entering it later is permitted.\n\n [`sub`]: #method.sub\n [allocation]: crate::ptr#allocation\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Iterate using a raw pointer in increments of two elements (backwards)\n let data = [1u8, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n let mut ptr: *const u8 = data.as_ptr();\n let start_rounded_down = ptr.wrapping_sub(2);\n ptr = ptr.wrapping_add(4);\n let step = 2;\n // This loop prints \"5, 3, 1, \"\n while ptr != start_rounded_down {\n     unsafe {\n         print!(\"{}, \", *ptr);\n     }\n     ptr = ptr.wrapping_sub(step);\n }\n ```\n"
