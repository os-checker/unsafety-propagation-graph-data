  "doc": " Consumes the `DropGuard`, returning the wrapped value.\n\n This will not execute the closure. It is typically preferred to call\n this function instead of `mem::forget` because it will return the stored\n value and drop variables captured by the closure instead of leaking their\n owned resources.\n\n # Example\n\n ```rust\n # #![allow(unused)]\n #![feature(drop_guard)]\n\n use std::mem::DropGuard;\n\n let value = String::from(\"Nori likes chicken\");\n let guard = DropGuard::new(value, |s| println!(\"{s}\"));\n assert_eq!(guard.dismiss(), \"Nori likes chicken\");\n ```\n"
