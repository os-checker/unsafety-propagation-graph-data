  "doc": " Returns the number of leading unset bits (zeroes) in an integer type `T`.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n\n The stabilized versions of this intrinsic are available on the integer\n primitives via the `leading_zeros` method. For example,\n [`u32::leading_zeros`]\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(core_intrinsics)]\n # #![allow(internal_features)]\n\n use std::intrinsics::ctlz;\n\n let x = 0b0001_1100_u8;\n let num_leading = ctlz(x);\n assert_eq!(num_leading, 3);\n ```\n\n An `x` with value `0` will return the bit width of `T`.\n\n ```\n #![feature(core_intrinsics)]\n # #![allow(internal_features)]\n\n use std::intrinsics::ctlz;\n\n let x = 0u16;\n let num_leading = ctlz(x);\n assert_eq!(num_leading, 16);\n ```\n"
