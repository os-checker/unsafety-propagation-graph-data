  "doc": " Returns an iterator that yields the literal escape code of a character\n as `char`s.\n\n The default is chosen with a bias toward producing literals that are\n legal in a variety of languages, including C++11 and similar C-family\n languages. The exact rules are:\n\n * Tab is escaped as `\\t`.\n * Carriage return is escaped as `\\r`.\n * Line feed is escaped as `\\n`.\n * Single quote is escaped as `\\'`.\n * Double quote is escaped as `\\\"`.\n * Backslash is escaped as `\\\\`.\n * Any character in the 'printable ASCII' range `0x20` .. `0x7e`\n   inclusive is not escaped.\n * All other characters are given hexadecimal Unicode escapes; see\n   [`escape_unicode`].\n\n [`escape_unicode`]: #method.escape_unicode\n\n # Examples\n\n As an iterator:\n\n ```\n for c in '\"'.escape_default() {\n     print!(\"{c}\");\n }\n println!();\n ```\n\n Using `println!` directly:\n\n ```\n println!(\"{}\", '\"'.escape_default());\n ```\n\n Both are equivalent to:\n\n ```\n println!(\"\\\\\\\"\");\n ```\n\n Using [`to_string`](../std/string/trait.ToString.html#tymethod.to_string):\n\n ```\n assert_eq!('\"'.escape_default().to_string(), \"\\\\\\\"\");\n ```\n"
