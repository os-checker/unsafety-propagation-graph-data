  "doc": " Writes a string slice into this writer, returning whether the write\n succeeded.\n\n This method can only succeed if the entire string slice was successfully\n written, and this method will not return until all data has been\n written or an error occurs.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an instance of [`std::fmt::Error`][Error] on error.\n\n The purpose of that error is to abort the formatting operation when the underlying\n destination encounters some error preventing it from accepting more text;\n in particular, it does not communicate any information about *what* error occurred.\n It should generally be propagated rather than handled, at least when implementing\n formatting traits.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::fmt::{Error, Write};\n\n fn writer<W: Write>(f: &mut W, s: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {\n     f.write_str(s)\n }\n\n let mut buf = String::new();\n writer(&mut buf, \"hola\")?;\n assert_eq!(&buf, \"hola\");\n # std::fmt::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n"
