  "doc": " Compares two iterators element-wise using the given function.\n\n If `ControlFlow::Continue(())` is returned from the function, the comparison moves on to the next\n elements of both iterators. Returning `ControlFlow::Break(x)` short-circuits the iteration and\n returns `ControlFlow::Break(x)`. If one of the iterators runs out of elements,\n `ControlFlow::Continue(ord)` is returned where `ord` is the result of comparing the lengths of\n the iterators.\n\n Isolates the logic shared by ['cmp_by'](Iterator::cmp_by),\n ['partial_cmp_by'](Iterator::partial_cmp_by), and ['eq_by'](Iterator::eq_by).\n"
