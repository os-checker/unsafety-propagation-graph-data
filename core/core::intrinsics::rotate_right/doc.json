  "doc": " Performs rotate right.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n\n The stabilized versions of this intrinsic are available on the integer\n primitives via the `rotate_right` method. For example,\n [`u32::rotate_right`]\n"
