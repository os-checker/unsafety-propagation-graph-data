  "doc": " Feeds a slice of this type into the given [`Hasher`].\n\n This method is meant as a convenience, but its implementation is\n also explicitly left unspecified. It isn't guaranteed to be\n equivalent to repeated calls of [`hash`] and implementations of\n [`Hash`] should keep that in mind and call [`hash`] themselves\n if the slice isn't treated as a whole unit in the [`PartialEq`]\n implementation.\n\n For example, a [`VecDeque`] implementation might naïvely call\n [`as_slices`] and then [`hash_slice`] on each slice, but this\n is wrong since the two slices can change with a call to\n [`make_contiguous`] without affecting the [`PartialEq`]\n result. Since these slices aren't treated as singular\n units, and instead part of a larger deque, this method cannot\n be used.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hash, Hasher};\n\n let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();\n let numbers = [6, 28, 496, 8128];\n Hash::hash_slice(&numbers, &mut hasher);\n println!(\"Hash is {:x}!\", hasher.finish());\n ```\n\n [`VecDeque`]: ../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html\n [`as_slices`]: ../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html#method.as_slices\n [`make_contiguous`]: ../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html#method.make_contiguous\n [`hash`]: Hash::hash\n [`hash_slice`]: Hash::hash_slice\n"
