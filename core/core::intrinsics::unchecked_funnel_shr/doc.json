  "doc": " Funnel Shift right.\n\n Concatenates `a` and `b` (with `a` in the most significant half),\n creating an integer twice as wide. Then shift this integer right\n by `shift` (taken modulo the bit size of `T`), and extract the\n least significant half. If `a` and `b` are the same, this is equivalent\n to a rotate right operation.\n\n It is undefined behavior if `shift` is greater than or equal to the\n bit size of `T`.\n\n Safer versions of this intrinsic are available on the integer primitives\n via the `funnel_shr` method. For example, [`u32::funnel_shr`]\n"
