  "doc": " Creates an iterator which, starting from an initial item,\n computes each successive item from the preceding one.\n\n This iterator stores an optional item (`Option<T>`) and a successor closure (`impl FnMut(&T) -> Option<T>`).\n Its `next` method returns the stored optional item and\n if it is `Some(val)` calls the stored closure on `&val` to compute and store its successor.\n The iterator will apply the closure successively to the stored option's value until the option is `None`.\n This also means that once the stored option is `None` it will remain `None`,\n as the closure will not be called again, so the created iterator is a [`FusedIterator`].\n The iterator's items will be the initial item and all of its successors as calculated by the successor closure.\n\n ```\n use std::iter::successors;\n\n let powers_of_10 = successors(Some(1_u16), |n| n.checked_mul(10));\n assert_eq!(powers_of_10.collect::<Vec<_>>(), &[1, 10, 100, 1_000, 10_000]);\n ```\n"
