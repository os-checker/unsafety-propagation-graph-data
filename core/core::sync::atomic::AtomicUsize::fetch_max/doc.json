  "doc": " Maximum with the current value.\n\n Finds the maximum of the current value and the argument `val`, and\n sets the new value to the result.\n\n Returns the previous value.\n\n `fetch_max` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic operations on\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_max(42, Ordering::SeqCst), 23);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 42);\n ```\n\n If you want to obtain the maximum value in one step, you can use the following:\n\n ```\n\n let bar = 42;\n let max_foo = foo.fetch_max(bar, Ordering::SeqCst).max(bar);\n assert!(max_foo == 42);\n ```\n"
