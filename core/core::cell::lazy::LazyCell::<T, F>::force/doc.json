This will cause all future\n accesses of the cell (via [`force()`] or a dereference) to panic.\n\n [`new()`]: LazyCell::new\n [`force()`]: LazyCell::force\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::LazyCell;\n\n let lazy = LazyCell::new(|| 92);\n\n assert_eq!(LazyCell::force(&lazy), &92);\n assert_eq!(&*lazy, &92);\n ```\n"
