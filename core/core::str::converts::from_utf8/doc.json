  "doc": " Converts a slice of bytes to a string slice.\n\n This is an alias to [`str::from_utf8`].\n\n A string slice ([`&str`]) is made of bytes ([`u8`]), and a byte slice\n ([`&[u8]`][byteslice]) is made of bytes, so this function converts between\n the two. Not all byte slices are valid string slices, however: [`&str`] requires\n that it is valid UTF-8. `from_utf8()` checks to ensure that the bytes are valid\n UTF-8, and then does the conversion.\n\n [`&str`]: str\n [byteslice]: slice\n\n If you are sure that the byte slice is valid UTF-8, and you don't want to\n incur the overhead of the validity check, there is an unsafe version of\n this function, [`from_utf8_unchecked`], which has the same\n behavior but skips the check.\n\n If you need a `String` instead of a `&str`, consider\n [`String::from_utf8`][string].\n\n [string]: ../../std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8\n\n Because you can stack-allocate a `[u8; N]`, and you can take a\n [`&[u8]`][byteslice] of it, this function is one way to have a\n stack-allocated string. There is an example of this in the\n examples section below.\n\n [byteslice]: slice\n\n # Errors\n\n Returns `Err` if the slice is not UTF-8 with a description as to why the\n provided slice is not UTF-8.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::str;\n\n // some bytes, in a vector\n let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];\n\n // We can use the ? (try) operator to check if the bytes are valid\n let sparkle_heart = str::from_utf8(&sparkle_heart)?;\n\n assert_eq!(\"💖\", sparkle_heart);\n # Ok::<_, str::Utf8Error>(())\n ```\n\n Incorrect bytes:\n\n ```\n use std::str;\n\n // some invalid bytes, in a vector\n let sparkle_heart = vec![0, 159, 146, 150];\n\n assert!(str::from_utf8(&sparkle_heart).is_err());\n ```\n\n See the docs for [`Utf8Error`] for more details on the kinds of\n errors that can be returned.\n\n A \"stack allocated string\":\n\n ```\n use std::str;\n\n // some bytes, in a stack-allocated array\n let sparkle_heart = [240, 159, 146, 150];\n\n // We know these bytes are valid, so just use `unwrap()`.\n let sparkle_heart: &str = str::from_utf8(&sparkle_heart).unwrap();\n\n assert_eq!(\"💖\", sparkle_heart);\n ```\n"
