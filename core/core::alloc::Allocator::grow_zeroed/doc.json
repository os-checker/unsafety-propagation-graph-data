  "doc": " Behaves like `grow`, but also ensures that the new contents are set to zero before being\n returned.\n\n The memory block will contain the following contents after a successful call to\n `grow_zeroed`:\n   * Bytes `0..old_layout.size()` are preserved from the original allocation.\n   * Bytes `old_layout.size()..old_size` will either be preserved or zeroed, depending on\n     the allocator implementation. `old_size` refers to the size of the memory block prior\n     to the `grow_zeroed` call, which may be larger than the size that was originally\n     requested when it was allocated.\n   * Bytes `old_size..new_size` are zeroed. `new_size` refers to the size of the memory\n     block returned by the `grow_zeroed` call.\n\n # Safety\n\n * `ptr` must denote a block of memory [*currently allocated*] via this allocator.\n * `old_layout` must [*fit*] that block of memory (The `new_layout` argument need not fit it.).\n * `new_layout.size()` must be greater than or equal to `old_layout.size()`.\n\n Note that `new_layout.align()` need not be the same as `old_layout.align()`.\n\n [*currently allocated*]: #currently-allocated-memory\n [*fit*]: #memory-fitting\n\n # Errors\n\n Returns `Err` if the new layout does not meet the allocator's size and alignment\n constraints of the allocator, or if growing otherwise fails.\n\n Implementations are encouraged to return `Err` on memory exhaustion rather than panicking or\n aborting, but this is not a strict requirement. (Specifically: it is *legal* to implement\n this trait atop an underlying native allocation library that aborts on memory exhaustion.)\n\n Clients wishing to abort computation in response to an allocation error are encouraged to\n call the [`handle_alloc_error`] function, rather than directly invoking `panic!` or similar.\n\n [`handle_alloc_error`]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html\n"
