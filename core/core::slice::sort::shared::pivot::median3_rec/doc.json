  "doc": " Calculates an approximate median of 3 elements from sections a, b, c, or\n recursively from an approximation of each, if they're large enough. By\n dividing the size of each section by 8 when recursing we have logarithmic\n recursion depth and overall sample from f(n) = 3*f(n/8) -> f(n) =\n O(n^(log(3)/log(8))) ~= O(n^0.528) elements.\n\n SAFETY: a, b, c must point to the start of initialized regions of memory of\n at least n elements.\n"
