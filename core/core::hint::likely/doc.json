  "doc": " Hints to the compiler that a branch condition is likely to be true.\n Returns the value passed to it.\n\n It can be used with `if` or boolean `match` expressions.\n\n When used outside of a branch condition, it may still influence a nearby branch, but\n probably will not have any effect.\n\n It can also be applied to parts of expressions, such as `likely(a) && unlikely(b)`, or to\n compound expressions, such as `likely(a && b)`. When applied to compound expressions, it has\n the following effect:\n ```text\n     likely(!a) => !unlikely(a)\n     likely(a && b) => likely(a) && likely(b)\n     likely(a || b) => a || likely(b)\n ```\n\n See also the function [`cold_path()`] which may be more appropriate for idiomatic Rust code.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(likely_unlikely)]\n use core::hint::likely;\n\n fn foo(x: i32) {\n     if likely(x > 0) {\n         println!(\"this branch is likely to be taken\");\n     } else {\n         println!(\"this branch is unlikely to be taken\");\n     }\n\n     match likely(x > 0) {\n         true => println!(\"this branch is likely to be taken\"),\n         false => println!(\"this branch is unlikely to be taken\"),\n     }\n\n     // Use outside of a branch condition may still influence a nearby branch\n     let cond = likely(x != 0);\n     if cond {\n         println!(\"this branch is likely to be taken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n"
