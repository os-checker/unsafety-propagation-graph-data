  "doc": " Shifts the bits to the left by a specified amount, `n`,\n wrapping the truncated bits to the end of the resulting integer.\n\n `rotate_left(n)` is equivalent to applying `rotate_left(1)` a total of `n` times. In\n particular, a rotation by the number of bits in `self` returns the input value\n unchanged.\n\n Please note this isn't the same operation as the `<<` shifting operator!\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n ```\n"
