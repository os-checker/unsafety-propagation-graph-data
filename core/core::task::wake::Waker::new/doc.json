  "doc": " Creates a new `Waker` from the provided `data` pointer and `vtable`.\n\n The `data` pointer can be used to store arbitrary data as required\n by the executor. This could be e.g. a type-erased pointer to an `Arc`\n that is associated with the task.\n The value of this pointer will get passed to all functions that are part\n of the `vtable` as the first parameter.\n\n It is important to consider that the `data` pointer must point to a\n thread safe type such as an `Arc`.\n\n The `vtable` customizes the behavior of a `Waker`. For each operation\n on the `Waker`, the associated function in the `vtable` will be called.\n\n # Safety\n\n The behavior of the returned `Waker` is undefined if the contract defined\n in [`RawWakerVTable`]'s documentation is not upheld.\n\n (Authors wishing to avoid unsafe code may implement the [`Wake`] trait instead, at the\n cost of a required heap allocation.)\n\n [`Wake`]: ../../alloc/task/trait.Wake.html\n"
