  "doc": " Creates a layout describing the record that can hold a value\n of the same layout as `self`, but that also is aligned to\n alignment `align` (measured in bytes).\n\n If `self` already meets the prescribed alignment, then returns\n `self`.\n\n Note that this method does not add any padding to the overall\n size, regardless of whether the returned layout has a different\n alignment. In other words, if `K` has size 16, `K.align_to(32)`\n will *still* have size 16.\n\n Returns an error if the combination of `self.size()` and the given\n `align` violates the conditions listed in [`Layout::from_size_align`].\n"
