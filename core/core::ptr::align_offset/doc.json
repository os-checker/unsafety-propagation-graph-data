  "doc": " Calculate an element-offset that increases a pointer's alignment.\n\n Calculate an element-offset (not byte-offset) that when added to a given pointer `p`, increases `p`'s alignment to at least the given alignment `a`.\n\n # Safety\n `a` must be a power of two.\n\n # Notes\n This implementation has been carefully tailored to not panic. It is UB for this to panic.\n The only real change that can be made here is change of `INV_TABLE_MOD_16` and associated\n constants.\n\n If we ever decide to make it possible to call the intrinsic with `a` that is not a\n power-of-two, it will probably be more prudent to just change to a naive implementation rather\n than trying to adapt this to accommodate that change.\n\n Any questions go to @nagisa.\n"
