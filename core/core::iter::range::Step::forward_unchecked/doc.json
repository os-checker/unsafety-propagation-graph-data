  "doc": " Returns the value that would be obtained by taking the *successor*\n of `self` `count` times.\n\n # Safety\n\n It is undefined behavior for this operation to overflow the\n range of values supported by `Self`. If you cannot guarantee that this\n will not overflow, use `forward` or `forward_checked` instead.\n\n # Invariants\n\n For any `a`:\n\n * if there exists `b` such that `b > a`, it is safe to call `Step::forward_unchecked(a, 1)`\n * if there exists `b`, `n` such that `steps_between(&a, &b) == Some(n)`,\n   it is safe to call `Step::forward_unchecked(a, m)` for any `m <= n`.\n   * Corollary: `Step::forward_unchecked(a, 0)` is always safe.\n\n For any `a` and `n`, where no overflow occurs:\n\n * `Step::forward_unchecked(a, n)` is equivalent to `Step::forward(a, n)`\n"
