  "doc": " An adapter for implementing non-try methods via the `Try` implementation.\n\n Conceptually the same as `Result<T, !>`, but requiring less work in trait\n solving and inhabited-ness checking and such, by being an obvious newtype\n and not having `From` bounds lying around.\n\n Not currently planned to be exposed publicly, so just `pub(crate)`.\n"
