  "doc": " Creates an array of type `[T; N]` by repeatedly cloning a value.\n\n This is the same as `[val; N]`, but it also works for types that do not\n implement [`Copy`].\n\n The provided value will be used as an element of the resulting array and\n will be cloned N - 1 times to fill up the rest. If N is zero, the value\n will be dropped.\n\n # Example\n\n Creating multiple copies of a `String`:\n ```rust\n use std::array;\n\n let string = \"Hello there!\".to_string();\n let strings = array::repeat(string);\n assert_eq!(strings, [\"Hello there!\", \"Hello there!\"]);\n ```\n"
