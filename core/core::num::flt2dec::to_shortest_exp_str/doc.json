  "doc": " Formats the given floating point number into the decimal form or\n the exponential form, depending on the resulting exponent. The result is\n stored to the supplied parts array while utilizing given byte buffer\n as a scratch. `upper` is used to determine the case of non-finite values\n (`inf` and `nan`) or the case of the exponent prefix (`e` or `E`).\n The first part to be rendered is always a `Part::Sign` (which can be\n an empty string if no sign is rendered).\n\n `format_shortest` should be the underlying digit-generation function.\n It should return the part of the buffer that it initialized.\n You probably would want `strategy::grisu::format_shortest` for this.\n\n The `dec_bounds` is a tuple `(lo, hi)` such that the number is formatted\n as decimal only when `10^lo <= V < 10^hi`. Note that this is the *apparent* `V`\n instead of the actual `v`! Thus any printed exponent in the exponential form\n cannot be in this range, avoiding any confusion.\n\n The byte buffer should be at least `MAX_SIG_DIGITS` bytes long.\n There should be at least 6 parts available, due to the worst case like\n `[+][1][.][2345][e][-][6]`.\n"
