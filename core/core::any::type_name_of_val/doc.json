  "doc": " Returns the type name of the pointed-to value as a string slice.\n\n This is the same as `type_name::<T>()`, but can be used where the type of a\n variable is not easily available.\n\n # Note\n\n Like [`type_name`], this is intended for diagnostic use and the exact output is not\n guaranteed. It provides a best-effort description, but the output may change between\n versions of the compiler.\n\n In short: use this for debugging, avoid using the output to affect program behavior. More\n information is available at [`type_name`].\n\n Additionally, this function does not resolve trait objects. This means that\n `type_name_of_val(&7u32 as &dyn Debug)` may return `\"dyn Debug\"`, but will not return `\"u32\"`\n at this time.\n\n # Examples\n\n Prints the default integer and float types.\n\n ```rust\n use std::any::type_name_of_val;\n\n let s = \"foo\";\n let x: i32 = 1;\n let y: f32 = 1.0;\n\n assert!(type_name_of_val(&s).contains(\"str\"));\n assert!(type_name_of_val(&x).contains(\"i32\"));\n assert!(type_name_of_val(&y).contains(\"f32\"));\n ```\n"
