  "doc": " Calculates the offset from a pointer in bytes (convenience for\n `.byte_offset((count as isize).wrapping_neg())`).\n\n `count` is in units of bytes.\n\n This is purely a convenience for casting to a `u8` pointer and\n using [`sub`][NonNull::sub] on it. See that method for documentation\n and safety requirements.\n\n For non-`Sized` pointees this operation changes only the data pointer,\n leaving the metadata untouched.\n"
