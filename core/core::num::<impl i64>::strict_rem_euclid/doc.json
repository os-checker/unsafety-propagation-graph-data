Computes `self.rem_euclid(rhs)`, panicking if\n the division results in overflow.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero.\n\n ## Overflow behavior\n\n This function will always panic on overflow, regardless of whether overflow checks are enabled.\n\n The only case where such an overflow can occur is `x % y` for `MIN / -1` on a\n signed type (where `MIN` is the negative minimal value), which is invalid due to implementation artifacts.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n\n The following panics because of division by zero:\n\n ```should_panic\n ```\n\n The following panics because of overflow:\n\n ```should_panic\n ```\n"
