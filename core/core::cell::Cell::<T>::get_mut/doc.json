  "doc": " Returns a mutable reference to the underlying data.\n\n This call borrows `Cell` mutably (at compile-time) which guarantees\n that we possess the only reference.\n\n However be cautious: this method expects `self` to be mutable, which is\n generally not the case when using a `Cell`. If you require interior\n mutability by reference, consider using `RefCell` which provides\n run-time checked mutable borrows through its [`borrow_mut`] method.\n\n [`borrow_mut`]: RefCell::borrow_mut()\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::Cell;\n\n let mut c = Cell::new(5);\n *c.get_mut() += 1;\n\n assert_eq!(c.get(), 6);\n ```\n"
