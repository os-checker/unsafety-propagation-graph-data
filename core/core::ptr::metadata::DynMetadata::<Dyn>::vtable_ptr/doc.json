  "doc": " When `DynMetadata` appears as the metadata field of a wide pointer, the rustc_middle layout\n computation does magic and the resulting layout is *not* a `FieldsShape::Aggregate`, instead\n it is a `FieldsShape::Primitive`. This means that the same type can have different layout\n depending on whether it appears as the metadata field of a wide pointer or as a stand-alone\n type, which understandably confuses codegen and leads to ICEs when trying to project to a\n field of `DynMetadata`. To work around that issue, we use `transmute` instead of using a\n field projection.\n"
