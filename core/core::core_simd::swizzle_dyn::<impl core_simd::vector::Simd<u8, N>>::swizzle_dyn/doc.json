  "doc": " Swizzle a vector of bytes according to the index vector.\n Indices within range select the appropriate byte.\n Indices \"out of bounds\" instead select 0.\n\n Note that the current implementation is selected during build-time\n of the standard library, so `cargo build -Zbuild-std` may be necessary\n to unlock better performance, especially for larger vectors.\n A planned compiler improvement will enable using `#[target_feature]` instead.\n"
