  "doc": " Shuffles two vectors by const indices.\n\n `T` must be a vector.\n\n `U` must be a **const** vector of `u32`s. This means it must either refer to a named\n const or be given as an inline const expression (`const { ... }`).\n\n `V` must be a vector with the same element type as `T` and the same length as `U`.\n\n Returns a new vector such that element `i` is selected from `xy[idx[i]]`, where `xy`\n is the concatenation of `x` and `y`. It is a compile-time error if `idx[i]` is out-of-bounds\n of `xy`.\n"
