Please see\n [write_str](Write::write_str) for details.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::fmt::{Error, Write};\n\n fn writer<W: Write>(f: &mut W, s: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {\n     f.write_fmt(format_args!(\"{s}\"))\n }\n\n let mut buf = String::new();\n writer(&mut buf, \"world\")?;\n assert_eq!(&buf, \"world\");\n # std::fmt::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n"
