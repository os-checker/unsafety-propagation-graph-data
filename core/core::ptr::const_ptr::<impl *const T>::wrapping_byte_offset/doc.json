  "doc": " Adds a signed offset in bytes to a pointer using wrapping arithmetic.\n\n `count` is in units of **bytes**.\n\n This is purely a convenience for casting to a `u8` pointer and\n using [wrapping_offset][pointer::wrapping_offset] on it. See that method\n for documentation.\n\n For non-`Sized` pointees this operation changes only the data pointer,\n leaving the metadata untouched.\n"
