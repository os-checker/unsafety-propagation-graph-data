If there is a pre-existing\n run that clears the `min_good_run_len` threshold it is returned as a sorted\n run. If not, the result depends on the value of `eager_sort`. If it is true,\n then a sorted run of length `T::SMALL_SORT_THRESHOLD` is returned, and if it\n is false an unsorted run of length `min_good_run_len` is returned.\n"
