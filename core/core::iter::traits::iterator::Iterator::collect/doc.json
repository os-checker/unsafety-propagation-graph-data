  "doc": " Transforms an iterator into a collection.\n\n `collect()` can take anything iterable, and turn it into a relevant\n collection. This is one of the more powerful methods in the standard\n library, used in a variety of contexts.\n\n The most basic pattern in which `collect()` is used is to turn one\n collection into another. You take a collection, call [`iter`] on it,\n do a bunch of transformations, and then `collect()` at the end.\n\n `collect()` can also create instances of types that are not typical\n collections. For example, a [`String`] can be built from [`char`]s,\n and an iterator of [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`] items can be collected\n into `Result<Collection<T>, E>`. See the examples below for more.\n\n Because `collect()` is so general, it can cause problems with type\n inference. As such, `collect()` is one of the few times you'll see\n the syntax affectionately known as the 'turbofish': `::<>`. This\n helps the inference algorithm understand specifically which collection\n you're trying to collect into.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let doubled: Vec<i32> = a.iter()\n                          .map(|x| x * 2)\n                          .collect();\n\n assert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n ```\n\n Note that we needed the `: Vec<i32>` on the left-hand side. This is because\n we could collect into, for example, a [`VecDeque<T>`] instead:\n\n [`VecDeque<T>`]: ../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let doubled: VecDeque<i32> = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();\n\n assert_eq!(2, doubled[0]);\n assert_eq!(4, doubled[1]);\n assert_eq!(6, doubled[2]);\n ```\n\n Using the 'turbofish' instead of annotating `doubled`:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let doubled = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<i32>>();\n\n assert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n ```\n\n Because `collect()` only cares about what you're collecting into, you can\n still use a partial type hint, `_`, with the turbofish:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let doubled = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<_>>();\n\n assert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n ```\n\n Using `collect()` to make a [`String`]:\n\n ```\n let chars = ['g', 'd', 'k', 'k', 'n'];\n\n let hello: String = chars.into_iter()\n     .map(|x| x as u8)\n     .map(|x| (x + 1) as char)\n     .collect();\n\n assert_eq!(\"hello\", hello);\n ```\n\n If you have a list of [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`]s, you can use `collect()` to\n see if any of them failed:\n\n ```\n let results = [Ok(1), Err(\"nope\"), Ok(3), Err(\"bad\")];\n\n let result: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = results.into_iter().collect();\n\n // gives us the first error\n assert_eq!(Err(\"nope\"), result);\n\n let results = [Ok(1), Ok(3)];\n\n let result: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = results.into_iter().collect();\n\n // gives us the list of answers\n assert_eq!(Ok(vec![1, 3]), result);\n ```\n\n [`iter`]: Iterator::next\n [`String`]: ../../std/string/struct.String.html\n [`char`]: type@char\n"
