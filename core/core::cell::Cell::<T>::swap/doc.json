  "doc": " Swaps the values of two `Cell`s.\n\n The difference with `std::mem::swap` is that this function doesn't\n require a `&mut` reference.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `self` and `other` are different `Cell`s that partially overlap.\n (Using just standard library methods, it is impossible to create such partially overlapping `Cell`s.\n However, unsafe code is allowed to e.g. create two `&Cell<[i32; 2]>` that partially overlap.)\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::Cell;\n\n let c1 = Cell::new(5i32);\n let c2 = Cell::new(10i32);\n c1.swap(&c2);\n assert_eq!(10, c1.get());\n assert_eq!(5, c2.get());\n ```\n"
