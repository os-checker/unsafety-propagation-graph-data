  "doc": " Returns [`true`] if this address is reserved by IANA for future use.\n\n [IETF RFC 1112] defines the block of reserved addresses as `240.0.0.0/4`.\n This range normally includes the broadcast address `255.255.255.255`, but\n this implementation explicitly excludes it, since it is obviously not\n reserved for future use.\n\n [IETF RFC 1112]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112\n\n # Warning\n\n As IANA assigns new addresses, this method will be\n updated. This may result in non-reserved addresses being\n treated as reserved in code that relies on an outdated version\n of this method.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(ip)]\n use std::net::Ipv4Addr;\n\n assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(240, 0, 0, 0).is_reserved(), true);\n assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(255, 255, 255, 254).is_reserved(), true);\n\n assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(239, 255, 255, 255).is_reserved(), false);\n // The broadcast address is not considered as reserved for future use by this implementation\n assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(255, 255, 255, 255).is_reserved(), false);\n ```\n"
