  "doc": " Loads a u64 using up to 7 bytes of a byte slice. It looks clumsy but the\n `copy_nonoverlapping` calls that occur (via `load_int_le!`) all have fixed\n sizes and avoid calling `memcpy`, which is good for speed.\n\n Safety: this performs unchecked indexing of `buf` at `start..start+len`, so\n that must be in-bounds.\n"
