  "doc": " Parse the significant digits and biased, binary exponent of a float.\n\n This is a fallback algorithm that uses a big-integer representation\n of the float, and therefore is considerably slower than faster\n approximations. However, it will always determine how to round\n the significant digits to the nearest machine float, allowing\n use to handle near half-way cases.\n\n Near half-way cases are halfway between two consecutive machine floats.\n For example, the float `16777217.0` has a bitwise representation of\n `100000000000000000000000 1`. Rounding to a single-precision float,\n the trailing `1` is truncated. Using round-nearest, tie-even, any\n value above `16777217.0` must be rounded up to `16777218.0`, while\n any value before or equal to `16777217.0` must be rounded down\n to `16777216.0`. These near-halfway conversions therefore may require\n a large number of digits to unambiguously determine how to round.\n\n The algorithms described here are based on \"Processing Long Numbers Quickly\",\n available here: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11408.pdf#section.11>.\n"
