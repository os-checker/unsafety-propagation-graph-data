  "doc": " Shifts the bits to the right by a specified amount, `n`,\n wrapping the truncated bits to the beginning of the resulting\n integer.\n\n `rotate_right(n)` is equivalent to applying `rotate_right(1)` a total of `n` times. In\n particular, a rotation by the number of bits in `self` returns the input value\n unchanged.\n\n Please note this isn't the same operation as the `>>` shifting operator!\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n ```\n"
