  "doc": " Creates an iterator that [`skip`]s elements based on a predicate.\n\n [`skip`]: Iterator::skip\n\n `skip_while()` takes a closure as an argument. It will call this\n closure on each element of the iterator, and ignore elements\n until it returns `false`.\n\n After `false` is returned, `skip_while()`'s job is over, and the\n rest of the elements are yielded.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [-1i32, 0, 1];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().skip_while(|x| x.is_negative());\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(0));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n Because the closure passed to `skip_while()` takes a reference, and many\n iterators iterate over references, this leads to a possibly confusing\n situation, where the type of the closure argument is a double reference:\n\n ```\n let s = &[-1, 0, 1];\n\n let mut iter = s.iter().skip_while(|x| **x < 0); // need two *s!\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&0));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n Stopping after an initial `false`:\n\n ```\n let a = [-1, 0, 1, -2];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().skip_while(|&x| x < 0);\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(0));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));\n\n // while this would have been false, since we already got a false,\n // skip_while() isn't used any more\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(-2));\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n"
