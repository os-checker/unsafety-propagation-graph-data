  "doc": " Gets a mutable reference to the data inside of this `Pin`.\n\n This requires that the data inside this `Pin` is `Unpin`.\n\n Note: `Pin` also implements `DerefMut` to the data, which can be used\n to access the inner value. However, `DerefMut` only provides a reference\n that lives for as long as the borrow of the `Pin`, not the lifetime of\n the `Pin` itself. This method allows turning the `Pin` into a reference\n with the same lifetime as the original `Pin`.\n"
