  "doc": " Returns `true` if this `LocalWaker` and another `LocalWaker` would awake the same task.\n\n This function works on a best-effort basis, and may return false even\n when the `Waker`s would awaken the same task. However, if this function\n returns `true`, it is guaranteed that the `Waker`s will awaken the same task.\n\n This function is primarily used for optimization purposes — for example,\n this type's [`clone_from`](Self::clone_from) implementation uses it to\n avoid cloning the waker when they would wake the same task anyway.\n"
