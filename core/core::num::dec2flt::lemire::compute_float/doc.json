This\n algorithm will accurately parse the vast majority of cases,\n and uses a 128-bit representation (with a fallback 192-bit\n representation).\n\n This algorithm scales the exponent by the decimal exponent\n using pre-computed powers-of-5, and calculates if the\n representation can be unambiguously rounded to the nearest\n machine float. Near-halfway cases are not handled here,\n and are represented by a negative, biased binary exponent.\n\n The algorithm is described in detail in \"Daniel Lemire, Number Parsing\n at a Gigabyte per Second\" in section 5, \"Fast Algorithm\", and\n section 6, \"Exact Numbers And Ties\", available online:\n <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11408.pdf>.\n"
