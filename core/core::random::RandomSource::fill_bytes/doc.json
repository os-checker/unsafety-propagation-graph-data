  "doc": " Fills `bytes` with random bytes.\n\n Note that calling `fill_bytes` multiple times is not equivalent to calling `fill_bytes` once\n with a larger buffer. A `RandomSource` is allowed to return different bytes for those two\n cases. For instance, this allows a `RandomSource` to generate a word at a time and throw\n part of it away if not needed.\n"
