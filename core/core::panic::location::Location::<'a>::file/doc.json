  "doc": " Returns the name of the source file from which the panic originated.\n\n # `&str`, not `&Path`\n\n The returned name refers to a source path on the compiling system, but it isn't valid to\n represent this directly as a `&Path`. The compiled code may run on a different system with\n a different `Path` implementation than the system providing the contents and this library\n does not currently have a different \"host path\" type.\n\n The most surprising behavior occurs when \"the same\" file is reachable via multiple paths in\n the module system (usually using the `#[path = \"...\"]` attribute or similar), which can\n cause what appears to be identical code to return differing values from this function.\n\n # Cross-compilation\n\n This value is not suitable for passing to `Path::new` or similar constructors when the host\n platform and target platform differ.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```should_panic\n use std::panic;\n\n panic::set_hook(Box::new(|panic_info| {\n     if let Some(location) = panic_info.location() {\n         println!(\"panic occurred in file '{}'\", location.file());\n     } else {\n         println!(\"panic occurred but can't get location information...\");\n     }\n }));\n\n panic!(\"Normal panic\");\n ```\n"
