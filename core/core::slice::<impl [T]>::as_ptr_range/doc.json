  "doc": " Returns the two raw pointers spanning the slice.\n\n The returned range is half-open, which means that the end pointer\n points *one past* the last element of the slice. This way, an empty\n slice is represented by two equal pointers, and the difference between\n the two pointers represents the size of the slice.\n\n See [`as_ptr`] for warnings on using these pointers. The end pointer\n requires extra caution, as it does not point to a valid element in the\n slice.\n\n This function is useful for interacting with foreign interfaces which\n use two pointers to refer to a range of elements in memory, as is\n common in C++.\n\n It can also be useful to check if a pointer to an element refers to an\n element of this slice:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n let x = &a[1] as *const _;\n let y = &5 as *const _;\n\n assert!(a.as_ptr_range().contains(&x));\n assert!(!a.as_ptr_range().contains(&y));\n ```\n\n [`as_ptr`]: slice::as_ptr\n"
