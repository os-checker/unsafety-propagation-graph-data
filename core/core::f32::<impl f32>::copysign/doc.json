  "span": "$library/core/src/num/f32.rs:1555:5: 1555:50",
  "doc": " Returns a number composed of the magnitude of `self` and the sign of\n `sign`.\n\n Equal to `self` if the sign of `self` and `sign` are the same, otherwise equal to `-self`.\n If `self` is a NaN, then a NaN with the same payload as `self` and the sign bit of `sign` is\n returned.\n\n If `sign` is a NaN, then this operation will still carry over its sign into the result. Note\n that IEEE 754 doesn't assign any meaning to the sign bit in case of a NaN, and as Rust\n doesn't guarantee that the bit pattern of NaNs are conserved over arithmetic operations, the\n result of `copysign` with `sign` being a NaN might produce an unexpected or non-portable\n result. See the [specification of NaN bit patterns](primitive@f32#nan-bit-patterns) for more\n info.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let f = 3.5_f32;\n\n assert_eq!(f.copysign(0.42), 3.5_f32);\n assert_eq!(f.copysign(-0.42), -3.5_f32);\n assert_eq!((-f).copysign(0.42), 3.5_f32);\n assert_eq!((-f).copysign(-0.42), -3.5_f32);\n\n assert!(f32::NAN.copysign(1.0).is_nan());\n ```\n"
