  "doc": " Lexicographically compare `[left, left + bytes)` and `[right, right + bytes)`\n as unsigned bytes, returning negative if `left` is less, zero if all the\n bytes match, or positive if `left` is greater.\n\n This underlies things like `<[u8]>::cmp`, and will usually lower to `memcmp`.\n\n # Safety\n\n `left` and `right` must each be [valid] for reads of `bytes` bytes.\n\n Note that this applies to the whole range, not just until the first byte\n that differs.  That allows optimizations that can read in large chunks.\n\n [valid]: crate::ptr#safety\n"
