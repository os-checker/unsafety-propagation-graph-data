  "doc": " Makes a new `RefMut` for an optional component of the borrowed data. The\n original guard is returned as an `Err(..)` if the closure returns\n `None`.\n\n The `RefCell` is already mutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RefMut::filter_map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the\n same name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};\n\n let c = RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);\n\n {\n     let b1: RefMut<'_, Vec<u32>> = c.borrow_mut();\n     let mut b2: Result<RefMut<'_, u32>, _> = RefMut::filter_map(b1, |v| v.get_mut(1));\n\n     if let Ok(mut b2) = b2 {\n         *b2 += 2;\n     }\n }\n\n assert_eq!(*c.borrow(), vec![1, 4, 3]);\n ```\n"
