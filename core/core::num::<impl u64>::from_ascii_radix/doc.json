  "doc": " Parses an integer from an ASCII-byte slice with digits in a given base.\n\n The characters are expected to be an optional\n sign followed by only digits. Leading and trailing non-digit characters (including\n whitespace) represent an error. Underscores (which are accepted in Rust literals)\n also represent an error.\n\n Digits are a subset of these characters, depending on `radix`:\n * `0-9`\n * `a-z`\n * `A-Z`\n\n # Panics\n\n This function panics if `radix` is not in the range from 2 to 36.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(int_from_ascii)]\n\n ```\n Trailing space returns error:\n ```\n # #![feature(int_from_ascii)]\n #\n ```\n"
