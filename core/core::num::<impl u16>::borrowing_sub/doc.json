  "doc": " Calculates `self` &minus; `rhs` &minus; `borrow` and returns a tuple\n containing the difference and the output borrow.\n\n Performs \"ternary subtraction\" by subtracting both an integer\n operand and a borrow-in bit from `self`, and returns an output\n integer and a borrow-out bit. This allows chaining together multiple\n subtractions to create a wider subtraction, and can be useful for\n bignum subtraction.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // ---------\n\n let borrow0 = false;\n\n let (diff0, borrow1) = a0.borrowing_sub(b0, borrow0);\n assert_eq!(borrow1, true);\n let (diff1, borrow2) = a1.borrowing_sub(b1, borrow1);\n assert_eq!(borrow2, false);\n\n ```\n"
