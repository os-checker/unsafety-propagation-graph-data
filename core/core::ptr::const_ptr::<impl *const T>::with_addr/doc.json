  "doc": " Creates a new pointer with the given address and the [provenance][crate::ptr#provenance] of\n `self`.\n\n This is similar to a `addr as *const T` cast, but copies\n the *provenance* of `self` to the new pointer.\n This avoids the inherent ambiguity of the unary cast.\n\n This is equivalent to using [`wrapping_offset`][pointer::wrapping_offset] to offset\n `self` to the given address, and therefore has all the same capabilities and restrictions.\n\n This is a [Strict Provenance][crate::ptr#strict-provenance] API.\n"
