  "doc": " Returns the contained [`Err`] value, but never panics.\n\n Unlike [`unwrap_err`], this method is known to never panic on the\n result types it is implemented for. Therefore, it can be used\n instead of `unwrap_err` as a maintainability safeguard that will fail\n to compile if the ok type of the `Result` is later changed\n to a type that can actually occur.\n\n [`unwrap_err`]: Result::unwrap_err\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n # #![feature(never_type)]\n # #![feature(unwrap_infallible)]\n\n fn only_bad_news() -> Result<!, String> {\n     Err(\"Oops, it failed\".into())\n }\n\n let error: String = only_bad_news().into_err();\n println!(\"{error}\");\n ```\n"
