All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic operations on\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_add(10, Ordering::SeqCst), 0);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), 10);\n ```\n"
