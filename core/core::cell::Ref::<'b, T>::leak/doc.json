  "doc": " Converts into a reference to the underlying data.\n\n The underlying `RefCell` can never be mutably borrowed from again and will always appear\n already immutably borrowed. It is not a good idea to leak more than a constant number of\n references. The `RefCell` can be immutably borrowed again if only a smaller number of leaks\n have occurred in total.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `Ref::leak(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the\n same name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(cell_leak)]\n use std::cell::{RefCell, Ref};\n let cell = RefCell::new(0);\n\n let value = Ref::leak(cell.borrow());\n assert_eq!(*value, 0);\n\n assert!(cell.try_borrow().is_ok());\n assert!(cell.try_borrow_mut().is_err());\n ```\n"
