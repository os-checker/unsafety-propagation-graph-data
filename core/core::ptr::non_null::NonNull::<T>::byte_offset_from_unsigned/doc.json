  "doc": " Calculates the distance between two pointers within the same allocation, *where it's known that\n `self` is equal to or greater than `origin`*. The returned value is in\n units of **bytes**.\n\n This is purely a convenience for casting to a `u8` pointer and\n using [`offset_from_unsigned`][NonNull::offset_from_unsigned] on it.\n See that method for documentation and safety requirements.\n\n For non-`Sized` pointees this operation considers only the data pointers,\n ignoring the metadata.\n"
