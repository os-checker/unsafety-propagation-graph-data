  "doc": " Pulls `N` items from `iter` and returns them as an array. If the iterator\n yields fewer than `N` items, `Err` is returned containing an iterator over\n the already yielded items.\n\n Since the iterator is passed as a mutable reference and this function calls\n `next` at most `N` times, the iterator can still be used afterwards to\n retrieve the remaining items.\n\n If `iter.next()` panics, all items already yielded by the iterator are\n dropped.\n\n Used for [`Iterator::next_chunk`].\n"
