  "doc": " Divides one mutable slice into two at an index, without doing bounds checking.\n\n The first will contain all indices from `[0, mid)` (excluding\n the index `mid` itself) and the second will contain all\n indices from `[mid, len)` (excluding the index `len` itself).\n\n For a safe alternative see [`split_at_mut`].\n\n # Safety\n\n Calling this method with an out-of-bounds index is *[undefined behavior]*\n even if the resulting reference is not used. The caller has to ensure that\n `0 <= mid <= self.len()`.\n\n [`split_at_mut`]: slice::split_at_mut\n [undefined behavior]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut v = [1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6];\n // scoped to restrict the lifetime of the borrows\n unsafe {\n     let (left, right) = v.split_at_mut_unchecked(2);\n     assert_eq!(left, [1, 0]);\n     assert_eq!(right, [3, 0, 5, 6]);\n     left[1] = 2;\n     right[1] = 4;\n }\n assert_eq!(v, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);\n ```\n"
