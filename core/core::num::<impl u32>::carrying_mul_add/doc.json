  "doc": " Calculates the \"full multiplication\" `self * rhs + carry + add`.\n\n This returns the low-order (wrapping) bits and the high-order (overflow) bits\n of the result as two separate values, in that order.\n\n This cannot overflow, as the double-width result has exactly enough\n space for the largest possible result. This is equivalent to how, in\n decimal, 9 × 9 + 9 + 9 = 81 + 18 = 99 = 9×10⁰ + 9×10¹ = 10² - 1.\n\n Performs \"long multiplication\" which takes in an extra amount to add, and may return an\n additional amount of overflow. This allows for chaining together multiple\n multiplications to create \"big integers\" which represent larger values.\n\n If you don't need the `add` part, then you can use [`Self::carrying_mul`] instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n Please note that this example is shared between integer types,\n which explains why `u32` is used here.\n\n ```\n assert_eq!(5u32.carrying_mul_add(2, 0, 0), (10, 0));\n assert_eq!(5u32.carrying_mul_add(2, 10, 10), (30, 0));\n assert_eq!(1_000_000_000u32.carrying_mul_add(10, 0, 0), (1410065408, 2));\n assert_eq!(1_000_000_000u32.carrying_mul_add(10, 10, 10), (1410065428, 2));\n ```\n\n This is the core per-digit operation for \"grade school\" O(n²) multiplication.\n\n Please note that this example is shared between integer types,\n using `u8` for simplicity of the demonstration.\n\n ```\n fn quadratic_mul<const N: usize>(a: [u8; N], b: [u8; N]) -> [u8; N] {\n     let mut out = [0; N];\n     for j in 0..N {\n         let mut carry = 0;\n         for i in 0..(N - j) {\n             (out[j + i], carry) = u8::carrying_mul_add(a[i], b[j], out[j + i], carry);\n         }\n     }\n     out\n }\n\n // -1 * -1 == 1\n assert_eq!(quadratic_mul([0xFF; 3], [0xFF; 3]), [1, 0, 0]);\n\n assert_eq!(u32::wrapping_mul(0x9e3779b9, 0x7f4a7c15), 0xcffc982d);\n assert_eq!(\n     quadratic_mul(u32::to_le_bytes(0x9e3779b9), u32::to_le_bytes(0x7f4a7c15)),\n     u32::to_le_bytes(0xcffc982d)\n );\n ```\n"
