  "doc": " Makes a new `RefMut` for a component of the borrowed data, e.g., an enum\n variant.\n\n The `RefCell` is already mutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RefMut::map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the same\n name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};\n\n let c = RefCell::new((5, 'b'));\n {\n     let b1: RefMut<'_, (u32, char)> = c.borrow_mut();\n     let mut b2: RefMut<'_, u32> = RefMut::map(b1, |t| &mut t.0);\n     assert_eq!(*b2, 5);\n     *b2 = 42;\n }\n assert_eq!(*c.borrow(), (42, 'b'));\n ```\n"
