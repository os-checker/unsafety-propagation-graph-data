  "doc": " Calculates `self` &minus; `rhs` &minus; `borrow` and checks for\n overflow.\n\n Performs \"ternary subtraction\" by subtracting both an integer\n operand and a borrow-in bit from `self`, and returns a tuple of the\n difference along with a boolean indicating whether an arithmetic\n overflow would occur. On overflow, the wrapped value is returned.\n\n This allows chaining together multiple subtractions to create a\n wider subtraction, and can be useful for bignum subtraction. This\n method should only be used for the most significant word; for the\n less significant words the unsigned method\n should be used.\n\n The output boolean returned by this method is *not* a borrow flag,\n and should *not* be subtracted from a more significant word.\n\n If the input borrow is false, this method is equivalent to\n [`overflowing_sub`](Self::overflowing_sub).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(bigint_helper_methods)]\n // Only the most significant word is signed.\n //\n // ---------\n\n let borrow0 = false;\n\n let (diff0, borrow1) = a0.borrowing_sub(b0, borrow0);\n assert_eq!(borrow1, true);\n\n let (diff1, overflow) = a1.borrowing_sub(b1, borrow1);\n assert_eq!(overflow, false);\n\n ```\n"
