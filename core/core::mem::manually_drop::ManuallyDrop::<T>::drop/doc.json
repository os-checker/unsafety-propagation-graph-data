  "doc": " Manually drops the contained value.\n\n This is exactly equivalent to calling [`ptr::drop_in_place`] with a\n pointer to the contained value. As such, unless the contained value is a\n packed struct, the destructor will be called in-place without moving the\n value, and thus can be used to safely drop [pinned] data.\n\n If you have ownership of the value, you can use [`ManuallyDrop::into_inner`] instead.\n\n # Safety\n\n This function runs the destructor of the contained value. Other than changes made by\n the destructor itself, the memory is left unchanged, and so as far as the compiler is\n concerned still holds a bit-pattern which is valid for the type `T`.\n\n However, this \"zombie\" value should not be exposed to safe code, and this function\n should not be called more than once. To use a value after it's been dropped, or drop\n a value multiple times, can cause Undefined Behavior (depending on what `drop` does).\n This is normally prevented by the type system, but users of `ManuallyDrop` must\n uphold those guarantees without assistance from the compiler.\n\n [pinned]: crate::pin\n"
