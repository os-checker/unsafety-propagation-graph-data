  "doc": " Creates an iterator which gives the current iteration count as well as\n the next value.\n\n The iterator returned yields pairs `(i, val)`, where `i` is the\n current index of iteration and `val` is the value returned by the\n iterator.\n\n `enumerate()` keeps its count as a [`usize`]. If you want to count by a\n different sized integer, the [`zip`] function provides similar\n functionality.\n\n # Overflow Behavior\n\n The method does no guarding against overflows, so enumerating more than\n [`usize::MAX`] elements either produces the wrong result or panics. If\n overflow checks are enabled, a panic is guaranteed.\n\n # Panics\n\n The returned iterator might panic if the to-be-returned index would\n overflow a [`usize`].\n\n [`zip`]: Iterator::zip\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().enumerate();\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((0, 'a')));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((1, 'b')));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((2, 'c')));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n"
