To determine\n whether the inclusive range is empty, use the [`is_empty()`] method\n instead of comparing `start() > end()`.\n\n Note: the value returned by this method is unspecified after the range\n has been iterated to exhaustion.\n\n [`start()`]: RangeInclusive::start\n [`is_empty()`]: RangeInclusive::is_empty\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n assert_eq!((3..=5).end(), &5);\n ```\n"
