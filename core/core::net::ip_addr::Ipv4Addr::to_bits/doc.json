  "doc": " Converts an IPv4 address into a `u32` representation using native byte order.\n\n Although IPv4 addresses are big-endian, the `u32` value will use the target platform's\n native byte order. That is, the `u32` value is an integer representation of the IPv4\n address and not an integer interpretation of the IPv4 address's big-endian bitstring. This\n means that the `u32` value masked with `0xffffff00` will set the last octet in the address\n to 0, regardless of the target platform's endianness.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::net::Ipv4Addr;\n\n let addr = Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78);\n assert_eq!(0x12345678, addr.to_bits());\n ```\n\n ```\n use std::net::Ipv4Addr;\n\n let addr = Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78);\n let addr_bits = addr.to_bits() & 0xffffff00;\n assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x00), Ipv4Addr::from_bits(addr_bits));\n\n ```\n"
