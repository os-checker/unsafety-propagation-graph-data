  "doc": " Bitwise \"nand\" with the current value.\n\n Performs a bitwise \"nand\" operation on the current value and the argument `val`, and\n sets the new value to the result.\n\n Returns the previous value.\n\n `fetch_nand` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic operations on\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_nand(0x31, Ordering::SeqCst), 0x13);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), !(0x13 & 0x31));\n ```\n"
