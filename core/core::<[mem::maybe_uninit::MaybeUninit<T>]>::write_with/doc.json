  "doc": " Fills a slice with elements returned by calling a closure for each index.\n\n This method uses a closure to create new values. If you'd rather `Clone` a given value, use\n [slice::write_filled]. If you want to use the `Default` trait to generate values, you can\n pass [`|_| Default::default()`][Default::default] as the argument.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if any call to the provided closure panics.\n\n If such a panic occurs, any elements previously initialized during this operation will be\n dropped.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(maybe_uninit_fill)]\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut buf = [const { MaybeUninit::<usize>::uninit() }; 5];\n let initialized = buf.write_with(|idx| idx + 1);\n assert_eq!(initialized, &mut [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n ```\n"
