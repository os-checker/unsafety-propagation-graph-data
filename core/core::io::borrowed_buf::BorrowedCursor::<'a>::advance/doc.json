  "doc": " Advances the cursor by asserting that `n` bytes have been filled.\n\n After advancing, the `n` bytes are no longer accessible via the cursor and can only be\n accessed via the underlying buffer. I.e., the buffer's filled portion grows by `n` elements\n and its unfilled portion (and the capacity of this cursor) shrinks by `n` elements.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller must ensure that the first `n` bytes of the cursor have been initialized. `n`\n must not exceed the remaining capacity of this cursor.\n"
