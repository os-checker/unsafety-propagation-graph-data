  "doc": " Aborts the execution of the process.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n\n [`std::process::abort`](../../std/process/fn.abort.html) is to be preferred if possible,\n as its behavior is more user-friendly and more stable.\n\n The current implementation of `intrinsics::abort` is to invoke an invalid instruction,\n on most platforms.\n On Unix, the\n process will probably terminate with a signal like `SIGABRT`, `SIGILL`, `SIGTRAP`, `SIGSEGV` or\n `SIGBUS`.  The precise behavior is not guaranteed and not stable.\n"
