  "doc": " Algorithm 1 is used if `min(left, right)` is small enough to fit onto a stack buffer. The\n `min(left, right)` elements are copied onto the buffer, `memmove` is applied to the others, and\n the ones on the buffer are moved back into the hole on the opposite side of where they\n originated.\n\n # Safety\n\n The specified range must be valid for reading and writing.\n"
