  "doc": " Performs full-width multiplication and addition with a carry:\n `multiplier * multiplicand + addend + carry`.\n\n This is possible without any overflow.  For `uN`:\n    MAX * MAX + MAX + MAX\n => (2ⁿ-1) × (2ⁿ-1) + (2ⁿ-1) + (2ⁿ-1)\n => (2²ⁿ - 2ⁿ⁺¹ + 1) + (2ⁿ⁺¹ - 2)\n => 2²ⁿ - 1\n\n For `iN`, the upper bound is MIN * MIN + MAX + MAX => 2²ⁿ⁻² + 2ⁿ - 2,\n and the lower bound is MAX * MIN + MIN + MIN => -2²ⁿ⁻² - 2ⁿ + 2ⁿ⁺¹.\n\n This currently supports unsigned integers *only*, no signed ones.\n The stabilized versions of this intrinsic are available on integers.\n"
