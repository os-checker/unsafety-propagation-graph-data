  "doc": " Advances the iterator by `n` elements.\n\n This method will eagerly skip `n` elements by calling [`next`] up to `n`\n times until [`None`] is encountered.\n\n `advance_by(n)` will return `Ok(())` if the iterator successfully advances by\n `n` elements, or a `Err(NonZero<usize>)` with value `k` if [`None`] is encountered,\n where `k` is remaining number of steps that could not be advanced because the iterator ran out.\n If `self` is empty and `n` is non-zero, then this returns `Err(n)`.\n Otherwise, `k` is always less than `n`.\n\n Calling `advance_by(0)` can do meaningful work, for example [`Flatten`]\n can advance its outer iterator until it finds an inner iterator that is not empty, which\n then often allows it to return a more accurate `size_hint()` than in its initial state.\n\n [`Flatten`]: crate::iter::Flatten\n [`next`]: Iterator::next\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(iter_advance_by)]\n\n use std::num::NonZero;\n\n let a = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n let mut iter = a.into_iter();\n\n assert_eq!(iter.advance_by(2), Ok(()));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));\n assert_eq!(iter.advance_by(0), Ok(()));\n assert_eq!(iter.advance_by(100), Err(NonZero::new(99).unwrap())); // only `4` was skipped\n ```\n"
