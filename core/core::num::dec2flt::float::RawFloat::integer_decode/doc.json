For 0, the\n exponent will be `-(EXP_BIAS + SIG_BITS)`, which is the minimum subnormal power. For\n infinity or NaN, the exponent will be `EXP_SAT - EXP_BIAS - SIG_BITS`.\n\n If subnormal, the mantissa will be shifted one bit to the left. Otherwise, it is returned\n with the explicit bit set but otherwise unshifted\n\n `s` is only ever +/-1.\n"
