  "doc": " Gets `Pin<&mut T>` to the underlying pinned value from this nested `Pin`-pointer.\n\n This is a generic method to go from `Pin<&mut Pin<Pointer<T>>>` to `Pin<&mut T>`. It is\n safe because the existence of a `Pin<Pointer<T>>` ensures that the pointee, `T`, cannot\n move in the future, and this method does not enable the pointee to move. \"Malicious\"\n implementations of `Ptr::DerefMut` are likewise ruled out by the contract of\n `Pin::new_unchecked`.\n"
