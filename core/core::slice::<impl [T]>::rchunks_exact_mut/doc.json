  "doc": " Returns an iterator over `chunk_size` elements of the slice at a time, starting at the end\n of the slice.\n\n The chunks are mutable slices, and do not overlap. If `chunk_size` does not divide the\n length of the slice, then the last up to `chunk_size-1` elements will be omitted and can be\n retrieved from the `into_remainder` function of the iterator.\n\n Due to each chunk having exactly `chunk_size` elements, the compiler can often optimize the\n resulting code better than in the case of [`chunks_mut`].\n\n See [`rchunks_mut`] for a variant of this iterator that also returns the remainder as a\n smaller chunk, and [`chunks_exact_mut`] for the same iterator but starting at the beginning\n of the slice.\n\n If your `chunk_size` is a constant, consider using [`as_rchunks_mut`] instead, which will\n give references to arrays of exactly that length, rather than slices.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `chunk_size` is zero.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let v = &mut [0, 0, 0, 0, 0];\n let mut count = 1;\n\n for chunk in v.rchunks_exact_mut(2) {\n     for elem in chunk.iter_mut() {\n         *elem += count;\n     }\n     count += 1;\n }\n assert_eq!(v, &[0, 2, 2, 1, 1]);\n ```\n\n [`chunks_mut`]: slice::chunks_mut\n [`rchunks_mut`]: slice::rchunks_mut\n [`chunks_exact_mut`]: slice::chunks_exact_mut\n [`as_rchunks_mut`]: slice::as_rchunks_mut\n"
