  "doc": " Version of [`try_from_fn`] using a passed-in slice in order to avoid\n needing to monomorphize for every array length.\n\n This takes a generator rather than an iterator so that *at the type level*\n it never needs to worry about running out of items.  When combined with\n an infallible `Try` type, that means the loop canonicalizes easily, allowing\n it to optimize well.\n\n It would be *possible* to unify this and [`iter_next_chunk_erased`] into one\n function that does the union of both things, but last time it was that way\n it resulted in poor codegen from the \"are there enough source items?\" checks\n not optimizing away.  So if you give it a shot, make sure to watch what\n happens in the codegen tests.\n"
