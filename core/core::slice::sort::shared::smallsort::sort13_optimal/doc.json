  "doc": " Sorts the first 13 elements of `v` with a fast fixed function.\n\n Should `is_less` generate substantial amounts of code the compiler can choose to not inline\n `swap_if_less`. If the code of a sort impl changes so as to call this function in multiple\n places, `#[inline(never)]` is recommended to keep binary-size in check. The current design of\n `small_sort_network` makes sure to only call this once.\n"
