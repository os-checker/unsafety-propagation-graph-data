  "doc": " Splits a `Ref` into multiple `Ref`s for different components of the\n borrowed data.\n\n The `RefCell` is already immutably borrowed, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `Ref::map_split(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the same\n name on the contents of a `RefCell` used through `Deref`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::cell::{Ref, RefCell};\n\n let cell = RefCell::new([1, 2, 3, 4]);\n let borrow = cell.borrow();\n let (begin, end) = Ref::map_split(borrow, |slice| slice.split_at(2));\n assert_eq!(*begin, [1, 2]);\n assert_eq!(*end, [3, 4]);\n ```\n"
