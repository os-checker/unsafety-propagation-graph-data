  "doc": " Splits a mutable slice into a mutable prefix, a middle of aligned SIMD types,\n and a mutable suffix.\n\n This is a safe wrapper around [`slice::align_to_mut`], so inherits the same\n guarantees as that method.\n\n This is the mutable version of [`slice::as_simd`]; see that for examples.\n\n # Panics\n\n This will panic if the size of the SIMD type is different from\n `LANES` times that of the scalar.\n\n At the time of writing, the trait restrictions on `Simd<T, LANES>` keeps\n that from ever happening, as only power-of-two numbers of lanes are\n supported.  It's possible that, in the future, those restrictions might\n be lifted in a way that would make it possible to see panics from this\n method for something like `LANES == 3`.\n"
