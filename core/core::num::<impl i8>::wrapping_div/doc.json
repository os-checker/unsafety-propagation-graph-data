  "doc": " Wrapping (modular) division. Computes `self / rhs`, wrapping around at the\n boundary of the type.\n\n The only case where such wrapping can occur is when one divides `MIN / -1` on a signed type (where\n `MIN` is the negative minimal value for the type); this is equivalent to `-MIN`, a positive value\n that is too large to represent in the type. In such a case, this function returns `MIN` itself.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n assert_eq!((-128i8).wrapping_div(-1), -128);\n ```\n"
