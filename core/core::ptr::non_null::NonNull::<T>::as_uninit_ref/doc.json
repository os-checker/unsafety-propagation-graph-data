In contrast to [`as_ref`], this does not require\n that the value has to be initialized.\n\n For the mutable counterpart see [`as_uninit_mut`].\n\n [`as_ref`]: NonNull::as_ref\n [`as_uninit_mut`]: NonNull::as_uninit_mut\n\n # Safety\n\n When calling this method, you have to ensure that\n the pointer is [convertible to a reference](crate::ptr#pointer-to-reference-conversion).\n Note that because the created reference is to `MaybeUninit<T>`, the\n source pointer can point to uninitialized memory.\n"
