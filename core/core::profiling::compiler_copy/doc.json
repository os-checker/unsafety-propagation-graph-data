  "doc": " Profiling marker for copy operations.\n\n This function is never called at runtime. When `-Z annotate-moves` is enabled,\n the compiler creates synthetic debug info that makes copy operations appear as\n calls to this function in profilers.\n\n The `SIZE` parameter encodes the size of the type being copied. It's the same as\n `size_of::<T>()`, and is only present for convenience.\n"
