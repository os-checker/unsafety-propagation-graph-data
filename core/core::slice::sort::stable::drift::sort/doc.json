  "doc": " Sorts `v` based on comparison function `is_less`. If `eager_sort` is true,\n it will only do small-sorts and physical merges, ensuring O(N * log(N))\n worst-case complexity. `scratch.len()` must be at least\n `max(v.len() - v.len() / 2, SMALL_SORT_GENERAL_SCRATCH_LEN)` otherwise the implementation may abort.\n Fully ascending and descending inputs will be sorted with exactly N - 1\n comparisons.\n\n This is the main loop for driftsort, which uses powersort's heuristic to\n determine in which order to merge runs, see below for details.\n"
