  "doc": " Views the underlying data as a subslice of the original data.\n\n To avoid creating `&mut` references that alias, this is forced\n to consume the iterator.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n // First, we need a slice to call the `iter_mut` method on:\n let mut slice = &mut [1, 2, 3];\n\n // Then we call `iter_mut` on the slice to get the `IterMut` struct:\n let mut iter = slice.iter_mut();\n // Now, we call the `next` method to remove the first element of the iterator,\n // unwrap and dereference what we get from `next` and increase its value by 1:\n *iter.next().unwrap() += 1;\n // Here the iterator does not contain the first element of the slice any more,\n // so `into_slice` only returns the last two elements of the slice,\n // and so this prints \"[2, 3]\":\n println!(\"{:?}\", iter.into_slice());\n // The underlying slice still contains three elements, but its first element\n // was increased by 1, so this prints \"[2, 2, 3]\":\n println!(\"{:?}\", slice);\n ```\n"
