  "doc": " Loads a vector from an array of `T`.\n\n This function is necessary since `repr(simd)` has padding for non-power-of-2 vectors (at the time of writing).\n With padding, `read_unaligned` will read past the end of an array of N elements.\n\n # Safety\n Reading `ptr` must be safe, as if by `<*const [T; N]>::read`.\n"
