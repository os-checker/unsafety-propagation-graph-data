  "doc": " Bitwise xor with the current value, returning the previous value.\n `T` must be an integer or pointer type.\n `U` must be the same as `T` if that is an integer type, or `usize` if `T` is a pointer type.\n\n The stabilized version of this intrinsic is available on the\n [`atomic`] types via the `fetch_xor` method. For example, [`AtomicBool::fetch_xor`].\n"
