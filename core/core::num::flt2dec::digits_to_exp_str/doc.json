  "doc": " Formats the given decimal digits `0.<...buf...> * 10^exp` into the exponential\n form with at least the given number of significant digits. When `upper` is `true`,\n the exponent will be prefixed by `E`; otherwise that's `e`. The result is\n stored to the supplied parts array and a slice of written parts is returned.\n\n `min_digits` can be less than the number of actual significant digits in `buf`;\n it will be ignored and full digits will be printed. It is only used to print\n additional zeroes after rendered digits. Thus, `min_digits == 0` means that\n it will only print the given digits and nothing else.\n"
