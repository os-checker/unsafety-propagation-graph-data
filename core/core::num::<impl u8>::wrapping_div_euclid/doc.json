  "doc": " Wrapping Euclidean division. Computes `self.div_euclid(rhs)`.\n\n Wrapped division on unsigned types is just normal division. There's\n no way wrapping could ever happen. This function exists so that all\n operations are accounted for in the wrapping operations. Since, for\n the positive integers, all common definitions of division are equal,\n this is exactly equal to `self.wrapping_div(rhs)`.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
