  "doc": " Returns an iterator over subslices separated by elements that match\n `pred` limited to returning at most `n` items. This starts at the end of\n the slice and works backwards. The matched element is not contained in\n the subslices.\n\n The last element returned, if any, will contain the remainder of the\n slice.\n\n # Examples\n\n Print the slice split once, starting from the end, by numbers divisible\n by 3 (i.e., `[50]`, `[10, 40, 30, 20]`):\n\n ```\n let v = [10, 40, 30, 20, 60, 50];\n\n for group in v.rsplitn(2, |num| *num % 3 == 0) {\n     println!(\"{group:?}\");\n }\n ```\n"
