After iterating again, it will start at the\n beginning again. And again. And again. Forever. Note that in case the\n original iterator is empty, the resulting iterator will also be empty.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().cycle();\n\n loop {\n     assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));\n     assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));\n     assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));\n #   break;\n }\n ```\n"
