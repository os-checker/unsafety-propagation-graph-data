  "doc": " Generates a DSB (data synchronization barrier) instruction or equivalent CP15 instruction.\n\n DSB ensures the completion of memory accesses. A DSB behaves as the equivalent DMB and has\n additional properties. After a DSB instruction completes, all memory accesses of the specified\n type issued before the DSB are guaranteed to have completed.\n\n The __dsb() intrinsic also acts as a compiler memory barrier of the appropriate type.\n"
