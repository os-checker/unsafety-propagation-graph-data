It must also be on the boundary of a UTF-8 code point.\n\n The two slices returned go from the start of the string slice to `mid`,\n and from `mid` to the end of the string slice.\n\n To get mutable string slices instead, see the [`split_at_mut`]\n method.\n\n [`split_at_mut`]: str::split_at_mut\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `mid` is not on a UTF-8 code point boundary, or if it is past\n the end of the last code point of the string slice.  For a non-panicking\n alternative see [`split_at_checked`](str::split_at_checked).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s = \"Per Martin-Löf\";\n\n let (first, last) = s.split_at(3);\n\n assert_eq!(\"Per\", first);\n assert_eq!(\" Martin-Löf\", last);\n ```\n"
