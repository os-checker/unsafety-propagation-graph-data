  "doc": " Returns an iterator over the lines of a string, as string slices.\n\n Lines are split at line endings that are either newlines (`\\n`) or\n sequences of a carriage return followed by a line feed (`\\r\\n`).\n\n Line terminators are not included in the lines returned by the iterator.\n\n Note that any carriage return (`\\r`) not immediately followed by a\n line feed (`\\n`) does not split a line. These carriage returns are\n thereby included in the produced lines.\n\n The final line ending is optional. A string that ends with a final line\n ending will return the same lines as an otherwise identical string\n without a final line ending.\n\n An empty string returns an empty iterator.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let text = \"foo\\r\\nbar\\n\\nbaz\\r\";\n let mut lines = text.lines();\n\n assert_eq!(Some(\"foo\"), lines.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(\"bar\"), lines.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(\"\"), lines.next());\n // Trailing carriage return is included in the last line\n assert_eq!(Some(\"baz\\r\"), lines.next());\n\n assert_eq!(None, lines.next());\n ```\n\n The final line does not require any ending:\n\n ```\n let text = \"foo\\nbar\\n\\r\\nbaz\";\n let mut lines = text.lines();\n\n assert_eq!(Some(\"foo\"), lines.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(\"bar\"), lines.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(\"\"), lines.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(\"baz\"), lines.next());\n\n assert_eq!(None, lines.next());\n ```\n\n An empty string returns an empty iterator:\n\n ```\n let text = \"\";\n let mut lines = text.lines();\n\n assert_eq!(lines.next(), None);\n ```\n"
