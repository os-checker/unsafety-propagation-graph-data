  "doc": " Return a pointer containing a randomly generated logical address tag.\n\n `src`: A pointer containing an address.\n `mask`: A mask where each of the lower 16 bits specifies logical\n         tags which must be excluded from consideration. Zero excludes no\n         tags.\n\n The returned pointer contains a copy of the `src` address, but with a\n randomly generated logical tag, excluding any specified by `mask`.\n\n SAFETY: The pointer provided by this intrinsic will be invalid until the memory\n has been appropriately tagged with `__arm_mte_set_tag`. If using that intrinsic\n on the provided pointer is itself invalid, then it will be permanently invalid\n and Undefined Behavior to dereference it.\n"
