  "doc": " An atomic fence.\n\n Fences create synchronization between themselves and atomic operations or fences in other\n threads. To achieve this, a fence prevents the compiler and CPU from reordering certain types of\n memory operations around it.\n\n There are 3 different ways to use an atomic fence:\n\n - atomic - fence synchronization: an atomic operation with (at least) [`Release`] ordering\n   semantics synchronizes with a fence with (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n - fence - atomic synchronization: a fence with (at least) [`Release`] ordering semantics\n   synchronizes with an atomic operation with (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n - fence - fence synchronization: a fence with (at least) [`Release`] ordering semantics\n   synchronizes with a fence with (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n\n These 3 ways complement the regular, fence-less, atomic - atomic synchronization.\n\n ## Atomic - Fence\n\n An atomic operation on one thread will synchronize with a fence on another thread when:\n\n -   on thread 1:\n     -   an atomic operation 'X' with (at least) [`Release`] ordering semantics on some atomic\n         object 'm',\n\n -   is paired on thread 2 with:\n     -   an atomic read 'Y' with any order on 'm',\n     -   followed by a fence 'B' with (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n\n This provides a happens-before dependence between X and B.\n\n ```text\n     Thread 1                                          Thread 2\n\n m.store(3, Release); X ---------\n                                |\n                                |\n                                -------------> Y  if m.load(Relaxed) == 3 {\n                                               B      fence(Acquire);\n                                                      ...\n                                                  }\n ```\n\n ## Fence - Atomic\n\n A fence on one thread will synchronize with an atomic operation on another thread when:\n\n -   on thread:\n     -   a fence 'A' with (at least) [`Release`] ordering semantics,\n     -   followed by an atomic write 'X' with any ordering on some atomic object 'm',\n\n -   is paired on thread 2 with:\n     -   an atomic operation 'Y' with (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n\n This provides a happens-before dependence between A and Y.\n\n ```text\n     Thread 1                                          Thread 2\n\n fence(Release);      A\n m.store(3, Relaxed); X ---------\n                                |\n                                |\n                                -------------> Y  if m.load(Acquire) == 3 {\n                                                      ...\n                                                  }\n ```\n\n ## Fence - Fence\n\n A fence on one thread will synchronize with a fence on another thread when:\n\n -   on thread 1:\n     -   a fence 'A' which has (at least) [`Release`] ordering semantics,\n     -   followed by an atomic write 'X' with any ordering on some atomic object 'm',\n\n -   is paired on thread 2 with:\n     -   an atomic read 'Y' with any ordering on 'm',\n     -   followed by a fence 'B' with (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n\n This provides a happens-before dependence between A and B.\n\n ```text\n     Thread 1                                          Thread 2\n\n fence(Release);      A --------------\n m.store(3, Relaxed); X ---------    |\n                                |    |\n                                |    |\n                                -------------> Y  if m.load(Relaxed) == 3 {\n                                     |-------> B      fence(Acquire);\n                                                      ...\n                                                  }\n ```\n\n ## Mandatory Atomic\n\n Note that in the examples above, it is crucial that the access to `m` are atomic. Fences cannot\n be used to establish synchronization between non-atomic accesses in different threads. However,\n thanks to the happens-before relationship, any non-atomic access that happen-before the atomic\n operation or fence with (at least) [`Release`] ordering semantics are now also properly\n synchronized with any non-atomic accesses that happen-after the atomic operation or fence with\n (at least) [`Acquire`] ordering semantics.\n\n ## Memory Ordering\n\n A fence which has [`SeqCst`] ordering, in addition to having both [`Acquire`] and [`Release`]\n semantics, participates in the global program order of the other [`SeqCst`] operations and/or\n fences.\n\n Accepts [`Acquire`], [`Release`], [`AcqRel`] and [`SeqCst`] orderings.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `order` is [`Relaxed`].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool;\n use std::sync::atomic::fence;\n use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;\n\n // A mutual exclusion primitive based on spinlock.\n pub struct Mutex {\n     flag: AtomicBool,\n }\n\n impl Mutex {\n     pub fn new() -> Mutex {\n         Mutex {\n             flag: AtomicBool::new(false),\n         }\n     }\n\n     pub fn lock(&self) {\n         // Wait until the old value is `false`.\n         while self\n             .flag\n             .compare_exchange_weak(false, true, Ordering::Relaxed, Ordering::Relaxed)\n             .is_err()\n         {}\n         // This fence synchronizes-with store in `unlock`.\n         fence(Ordering::Acquire);\n     }\n\n     pub fn unlock(&self) {\n         self.flag.store(false, Ordering::Release);\n     }\n }\n ```\n"
