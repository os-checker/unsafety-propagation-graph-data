Computes `-self`,\n wrapping around at the boundary of the type.\n\n Since unsigned types do not have negative equivalents\n all applications of this function will wrap (except for `-0`).\n For values smaller than the corresponding signed type's maximum\n the result is the same as casting the corresponding signed value.\n Any larger values are equivalent to `MAX + 1 - (val - MAX - 1)` where\n `MAX` is the corresponding signed type's maximum.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n"
