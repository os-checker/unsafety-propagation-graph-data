  "doc": " Calculates the midpoint (average) between `self` and `rhs`.\n\n `midpoint(a, b)` is `(a + b) >> 1` as if it were performed in a\n sufficiently-large signed integral type. This implies that the result is\n always rounded towards negative infinity and that no overflow will ever occur.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n # use std::num::NonZero;\n #\n # fn main() { test().unwrap(); }\n # fn test() -> Option<()> {\n\n assert_eq!(one.midpoint(four), two);\n assert_eq!(four.midpoint(one), two);\n # Some(())\n # }\n ```\n"
