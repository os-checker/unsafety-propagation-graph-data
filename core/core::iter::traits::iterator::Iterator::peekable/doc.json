  "doc": " Creates an iterator which can use the [`peek`] and [`peek_mut`] methods\n to look at the next element of the iterator without consuming it. See\n their documentation for more information.\n\n Note that the underlying iterator is still advanced when [`peek`] or\n [`peek_mut`] are called for the first time: In order to retrieve the\n next element, [`next`] is called on the underlying iterator, hence any\n side effects (i.e. anything other than fetching the next value) of\n the [`next`] method will occur.\n\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let xs = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = xs.into_iter().peekable();\n\n // peek() lets us see into the future\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), Some(&1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));\n\n // we can peek() multiple times, the iterator won't advance\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), Some(&3));\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), Some(&3));\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));\n\n // after the iterator is finished, so is peek()\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), None);\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n Using [`peek_mut`] to mutate the next item without advancing the\n iterator:\n\n ```\n let xs = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = xs.into_iter().peekable();\n\n // `peek_mut()` lets us see into the future\n assert_eq!(iter.peek_mut(), Some(&mut 1));\n assert_eq!(iter.peek_mut(), Some(&mut 1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));\n\n if let Some(p) = iter.peek_mut() {\n     assert_eq!(*p, 2);\n     // put a value into the iterator\n     *p = 1000;\n }\n\n // The value reappears as the iterator continues\n assert_eq!(iter.collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec![1000, 3]);\n ```\n [`peek`]: Peekable::peek\n [`peek_mut`]: Peekable::peek_mut\n [`next`]: Iterator::next\n"
