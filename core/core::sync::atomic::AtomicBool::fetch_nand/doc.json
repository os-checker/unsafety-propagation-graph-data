  "doc": " Logical \"nand\" with a boolean value.\n\n Performs a logical \"nand\" operation on the current value and the argument `val`, and sets\n the new value to the result.\n\n Returns the previous value.\n\n `fetch_nand` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note:** This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on `u8`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\n let foo = AtomicBool::new(true);\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_nand(false, Ordering::SeqCst), true);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), true);\n\n let foo = AtomicBool::new(true);\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_nand(true, Ordering::SeqCst), true);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst) as usize, 0);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), false);\n\n let foo = AtomicBool::new(false);\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_nand(false, Ordering::SeqCst), false);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::SeqCst), true);\n ```\n"
