  "doc": " Returns [`true`] if the address appears to be globally reachable\n as specified by the [IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry].\n\n Whether or not an address is practically reachable will depend on your\n network configuration. Most IPv6 addresses are globally reachable, unless\n they are specifically defined as *not* globally reachable.\n\n Non-exhaustive list of notable addresses that are not globally reachable:\n - The [unspecified address] ([`is_unspecified`](Ipv6Addr::is_unspecified))\n - The [loopback address] ([`is_loopback`](Ipv6Addr::is_loopback))\n - IPv4-mapped addresses\n - Addresses reserved for benchmarking ([`is_benchmarking`](Ipv6Addr::is_benchmarking))\n - Addresses reserved for documentation ([`is_documentation`](Ipv6Addr::is_documentation))\n - Unique local addresses ([`is_unique_local`](Ipv6Addr::is_unique_local))\n - Unicast addresses with link-local scope ([`is_unicast_link_local`](Ipv6Addr::is_unicast_link_local))\n\n For the complete overview of which addresses are globally reachable, see the table at the [IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry].\n\n Note that an address having global scope is not the same as being globally reachable,\n and there is no direct relation between the two concepts: There exist addresses with global scope\n that are not globally reachable (for example unique local addresses),\n and addresses that are globally reachable without having global scope\n (multicast addresses with non-global scope).\n\n [IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml\n [unspecified address]: Ipv6Addr::UNSPECIFIED\n [loopback address]: Ipv6Addr::LOCALHOST\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(ip)]\n\n use std::net::Ipv6Addr;\n\n // Most IPv6 addresses are globally reachable:\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0x26, 0, 0x1c9, 0, 0, 0xafc8, 0x10, 0x1).is_global(), true);\n\n // However some addresses have been assigned a special meaning\n // that makes them not globally reachable. Some examples are:\n\n // The unspecified address (`::`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::UNSPECIFIED.is_global(), false);\n\n // The loopback address (`::1`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::LOCALHOST.is_global(), false);\n\n // IPv4-mapped addresses (`::ffff:0:0/96`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0xffff, 0xc00a, 0x2ff).is_global(), false);\n\n // Addresses reserved for benchmarking (`2001:2::/48`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0x2001, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,).is_global(), false);\n\n // Addresses reserved for documentation (`2001:db8::/32` and `3fff::/20`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0x2001, 0xdb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1).is_global(), false);\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0x3fff, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).is_global(), false);\n\n // Unique local addresses (`fc00::/7`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0xfc02, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1).is_global(), false);\n\n // Unicast addresses with link-local scope (`fe80::/10`)\n assert_eq!(Ipv6Addr::new(0xfe81, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1).is_global(), false);\n\n // For a complete overview see the IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry.\n ```\n"
