  "doc": " Stores a value into the atomic integer, returning the previous value.\n\n `swap` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic operations on\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n\n assert_eq!(some_var.swap(10, Ordering::Relaxed), 5);\n ```\n"
