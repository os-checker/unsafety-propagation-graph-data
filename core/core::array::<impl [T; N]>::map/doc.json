  "doc": " Returns an array of the same size as `self`, with function `f` applied to each element\n in order.\n\n If you don't necessarily need a new fixed-size array, consider using\n [`Iterator::map`] instead.\n\n\n # Note on performance and stack usage\n\n Unfortunately, usages of this method are currently not always optimized\n as well as they could be. This mainly concerns large arrays, as mapping\n over small arrays seem to be optimized just fine. Also note that in\n debug mode (i.e. without any optimizations), this method can use a lot\n of stack space (a few times the size of the array or more).\n\n Therefore, in performance-critical code, try to avoid using this method\n on large arrays or check the emitted code. Also try to avoid chained\n maps (e.g. `arr.map(...).map(...)`).\n\n In many cases, you can instead use [`Iterator::map`] by calling `.iter()`\n or `.into_iter()` on your array. `[T; N]::map` is only necessary if you\n really need a new array of the same size as the result. Rust's lazy\n iterators tend to get optimized very well.\n\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = [1, 2, 3];\n let y = x.map(|v| v + 1);\n assert_eq!(y, [2, 3, 4]);\n\n let x = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut temp = 0;\n let y = x.map(|v| { temp += 1; v * temp });\n assert_eq!(y, [1, 4, 9]);\n\n let x = [\"Ferris\", \"Bueller's\", \"Day\", \"Off\"];\n let y = x.map(|v| v.len());\n assert_eq!(y, [6, 9, 3, 3]);\n ```\n"
