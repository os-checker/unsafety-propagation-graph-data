This is the same behavior as\n       [`Layout::for_value`] on a reference to an extern type tail.\n     - otherwise, it is conservatively not allowed to call this function.\n\n [trait object]: ../../book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html\n [extern type]: ../../unstable-book/language-features/extern-types.html\n"
