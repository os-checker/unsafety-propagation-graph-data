  "doc": " Formats given floating point number into the decimal form with exactly\n given number of fractional digits. The result is stored to the supplied parts\n array while utilizing given byte buffer as a scratch. `upper` is currently\n unused but left for the future decision to change the case of non-finite values,\n i.e., `inf` and `nan`. The first part to be rendered is always a `Part::Sign`\n (which can be an empty string if no sign is rendered).\n\n `format_exact` should be the underlying digit-generation function.\n It should return the part of the buffer that it initialized.\n You probably would want `strategy::grisu::format_exact` for this.\n\n The byte buffer should be enough for the output unless `frac_digits` is\n so large that only the fixed number of digits will be ever written.\n (The tipping point for `f64` is about 800, and 1000 bytes should be enough.)\n There should be at least 4 parts available, due to the worst case like\n `[+][0.][0000][2][0000]` with `frac_digits = 10`.\n"
