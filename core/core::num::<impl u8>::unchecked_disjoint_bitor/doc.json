  "doc": " Same value as `self | other`, but UB if any bit position is set in both inputs.\n\n This is a situational micro-optimization for places where you'd rather\n use addition on some platforms and bitwise or on other platforms, based\n on exactly which instructions combine better with whatever else you're\n doing.  Note that there's no reason to bother using this for places\n where it's clear from the operations involved that they can't overlap.\n For example, if you're combining `u16`s into a `u32` with\n `((a as u32) << 16) | (b as u32)`, that's fine, as the backend will\n know those sides of the `|` are disjoint without needing help.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(disjoint_bitor)]\n\n // SAFETY: `1` and `4` have no bits in common.\n unsafe {\n }\n ```\n\n # Safety\n\n Requires that `(self & other) == 0`, otherwise it's immediate UB.\n\n Equivalently, requires that `(self | other) == (self + other)`.\n"
