  "doc": " Calls a closure on each element of an iterator.\n\n This is equivalent to using a [`for`] loop on the iterator, although\n `break` and `continue` are not possible from a closure. It's generally\n more idiomatic to use a `for` loop, but `for_each` may be more legible\n when processing items at the end of longer iterator chains. In some\n cases `for_each` may also be faster than a loop, because it will use\n internal iteration on adapters like `Chain`.\n\n [`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::sync::mpsc::channel;\n\n let (tx, rx) = channel();\n (0..5).map(|x| x * 2 + 1)\n       .for_each(move |x| tx.send(x).unwrap());\n\n let v: Vec<_> = rx.iter().collect();\n assert_eq!(v, vec![1, 3, 5, 7, 9]);\n ```\n\n For such a small example, a `for` loop may be cleaner, but `for_each`\n might be preferable to keep a functional style with longer iterators:\n\n ```\n (0..5).flat_map(|x| (x * 100)..(x * 110))\n       .enumerate()\n       .filter(|&(i, x)| (i + x) % 3 == 0)\n       .for_each(|(i, x)| println!(\"{i}:{x}\"));\n ```\n"
