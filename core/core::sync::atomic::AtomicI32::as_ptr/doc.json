All modifications of an atomic change the value\n through a shared reference, and can do so safely as long as they use atomic operations. Any\n use of the returned raw pointer requires an `unsafe` block and still has to uphold the\n requirements of the [memory model].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```ignore (extern-declaration)\n # fn main() {\n\n extern \"C\" {\n }\n\n\n // SAFETY: Safe as long as `my_atomic_op` is atomic.\n unsafe {\n     my_atomic_op(atomic.as_ptr());\n }\n # }\n ```\n\n [memory model]: self#memory-model-for-atomic-accesses\n"
