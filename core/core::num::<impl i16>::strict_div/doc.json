Computes `self / rhs`, panicking\n if overflow occurred.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero.\n\n ## Overflow behavior\n\n This function will always panic on overflow, regardless of whether overflow checks are enabled.\n\n The only case where such an overflow can occur is when one divides `MIN / -1` on a signed type (where\n `MIN` is the negative minimal value for the type); this is equivalent to `-MIN`, a positive value\n that is too large to represent in the type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n ```\n\n The following panics because of overflow:\n\n ```should_panic\n ```\n\n The following panics because of division by zero:\n\n ```should_panic\n ```\n"
