  "doc": " Constructs a new `Pin<Ptr>` around a pointer to some data of a type that\n implements [`Unpin`].\n\n Unlike `Pin::new_unchecked`, this method is safe because the pointer\n `Ptr` dereferences to an [`Unpin`] type, which cancels the pinning guarantees.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::pin::Pin;\n\n let mut val: u8 = 5;\n\n // Since `val` doesn't care about being moved, we can safely create a \"facade\" `Pin`\n // which will allow `val` to participate in `Pin`-bound apis  without checking that\n // pinning guarantees are actually upheld.\n let mut pinned: Pin<&mut u8> = Pin::new(&mut val);\n ```\n"
