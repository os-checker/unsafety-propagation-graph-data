  "doc": " Returns the two unsafe mutable pointers spanning the slice.\n\n The returned range is half-open, which means that the end pointer\n points *one past* the last element of the slice. This way, an empty\n slice is represented by two equal pointers, and the difference between\n the two pointers represents the size of the slice.\n\n See [`as_mut_ptr`] for warnings on using these pointers. The end\n pointer requires extra caution, as it does not point to a valid element\n in the slice.\n\n This function is useful for interacting with foreign interfaces which\n use two pointers to refer to a range of elements in memory, as is\n common in C++.\n\n [`as_mut_ptr`]: slice::as_mut_ptr\n"
