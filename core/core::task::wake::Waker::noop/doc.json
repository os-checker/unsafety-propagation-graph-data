  "doc": " Returns a reference to a `Waker` that does nothing when used.\n\n This is mostly useful for writing tests that need a [`Context`] to poll\n some futures, but are not expecting those futures to wake the waker or\n do not need to do anything specific if it happens.\n\n More generally, using `Waker::noop()` to poll a future\n means discarding the notification of when the future should be polled again.\n So it should only be used when such a notification will not be needed to make progress.\n\n If an owned `Waker` is needed, `clone()` this one.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::future::Future;\n use std::task;\n\n let mut cx = task::Context::from_waker(task::Waker::noop());\n\n let mut future = Box::pin(async { 10 });\n assert_eq!(future.as_mut().poll(&mut cx), task::Poll::Ready(10));\n ```\n"
