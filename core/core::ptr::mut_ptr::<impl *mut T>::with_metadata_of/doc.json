  "doc": " Uses the address value in a new pointer of another type.\n\n This operation will ignore the address part of its `meta` operand and discard existing\n metadata of `self`. For pointers to a sized types (thin pointers), this has the same effect\n as a simple cast. For pointers to an unsized type (fat pointers) this recombines the address\n with new metadata such as slice lengths or `dyn`-vtable.\n\n The resulting pointer will have provenance of `self`. This operation is semantically the\n same as creating a new pointer with the data pointer value of `self` but the metadata of\n `meta`, being fat or thin depending on the `meta` operand.\n\n # Examples\n\n This function is primarily useful for enabling pointer arithmetic on potentially fat\n pointers. The pointer is cast to a sized pointee to utilize offset operations and then\n recombined with its own original metadata.\n\n ```\n #![feature(set_ptr_value)]\n # use core::fmt::Debug;\n let mut arr: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut ptr = arr.as_mut_ptr() as *mut dyn Debug;\n let thin = ptr as *mut u8;\n unsafe {\n     ptr = thin.add(8).with_metadata_of(ptr);\n     # assert_eq!(*(ptr as *mut i32), 3);\n     println!(\"{:?}\", &*ptr); // will print \"3\"\n }\n ```\n\n # *Incorrect* usage\n\n The provenance from pointers is *not* combined. The result must only be used to refer to the\n address allowed by `self`.\n\n ```rust,no_run\n #![feature(set_ptr_value)]\n let mut x = 0u32;\n let mut y = 1u32;\n\n let x = (&mut x) as *mut u32;\n let y = (&mut y) as *mut u32;\n\n let offset = (x as usize - y as usize) / 4;\n let bad = x.wrapping_add(offset).with_metadata_of(y);\n\n // This dereference is UB. The pointer only has provenance for `x` but points to `y`.\n println!(\"{:?}\", unsafe { &*bad });\n ```\n"
