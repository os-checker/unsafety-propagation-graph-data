Calling `assume_init`\n    // provides enough information to know that this is a typed operation.\n\n    // However, as of March 2023 the compiler was not capable of taking advantage\n    // of that information. Thus, the implementation here switched to an intrinsic,\n    // which lowers to `_0 = *src` in MIR, to address a few issues:\n    //\n    // - Using `MaybeUninit::assume_init` after a `copy_nonoverlapping` was not\n    //   turning the untyped copy into a typed load. As such, the generated\n    //   `load` in LLVM didn't get various metadata, such as `!range` (#73258),\n    //   `!nonnull`, and `!noundef`, resulting in poorer optimization.\n    // - Going through the extra local resulted in multiple extra copies, even\n    //   in optimized MIR.  (Ignoring StorageLive/Dead, the intrinsic is one\n    //   MIR statement, while the previous implementation was eight.)  LLVM\n    //   could sometimes optimize them away, but because `read` is at the core\n    //   of so many things, not having them in the first place improves what we\n    //   hand off to the backend.  For example, `mem::replace::<Big>` previously\n    //   emitted 4 `alloca` and 6 `memcpy`s, but is now 1 `alloc` and 3 `memcpy`s.\n    // - In general, this approach keeps us from getting any more bugs (like\n    //   #106369) that boil down to \"`read(p)` is worse than `*p`\", as this\n    //   makes them look identical to the backend (or other MIR consumers).\n    //\n    // Future enhancements to MIR optimizations might well allow this to return\n    // to the previous implementation, rather than using an intrinsic.\n\n    // SAFETY: the caller must guarantee that `src` is valid for reads.\n    unsafe {\n        #[cfg(debug_assertions)] // Too expensive to always enable (for now?)\n        ub_checks::assert_unsafe_precondition!(\n            check_language_ub,\n            \"ptr::read requires that the pointer argument is aligned and non-null\",\n            (\n                addr: *const () = src as *const (),\n                align: usize = align_of::<T>(),\n                is_zst: bool = T::IS_ZST,\n            ) => ub_checks::maybe_is_aligned_and_not_null(addr, align, is_zst)\n        );\n        crate::intrinsics::read_via_copy(src)\n    }\n}"
