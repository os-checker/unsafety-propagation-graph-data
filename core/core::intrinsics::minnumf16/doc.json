  "doc": " Returns the minimum of two `f16` values, ignoring NaN.\n\n This behaves like IEEE 754-2008 minNum. In particular:\n If one of the arguments is NaN, then the other argument is returned. If the inputs compare equal\n (such as for the case of `+0.0` and `-0.0`), either input may be returned non-deterministically.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n\n The stabilized version of this intrinsic is [`f16::min`].\n"
