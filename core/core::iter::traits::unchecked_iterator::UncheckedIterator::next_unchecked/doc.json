  "doc": " Gets the next item from a non-empty iterator.\n\n Because there's always a value to return, that means it can return\n the `Item` type directly, without wrapping it in an `Option`.\n\n # Safety\n\n This can only be called if `size_hint().0 != 0`, guaranteeing that\n there's at least one item available.\n\n Otherwise (aka when `size_hint().1 == Some(0)`), this is UB.\n\n # Note to Implementers\n\n This has a default implementation using [`Option::unwrap_unchecked`].\n That's probably sufficient if your `next` *always* returns `Some`,\n such as for infinite iterators.  In more complicated situations, however,\n sometimes there can still be `insertvalue`/`assume`/`extractvalue`\n instructions remaining in the IR from the `Option` handling, at which\n point you might want to implement this manually instead.\n"
