  "doc": " Resumes the execution of this coroutine.\n\n This function will resume execution of the coroutine or start execution\n if it hasn't already. This call will return back into the coroutine's\n last suspension point, resuming execution from the latest `yield`. The\n coroutine will continue executing until it either yields or returns, at\n which point this function will return.\n\n # Return value\n\n The `CoroutineState` enum returned from this function indicates what\n state the coroutine is in upon returning. If the `Yielded` variant is\n returned then the coroutine has reached a suspension point and a value\n has been yielded out. Coroutines in this state are available for\n resumption at a later point.\n\n If `Complete` is returned then the coroutine has completely finished\n with the value provided. It is invalid for the coroutine to be resumed\n again.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function may panic if it is called after the `Complete` variant has\n been returned previously. While coroutine literals in the language are\n guaranteed to panic on resuming after `Complete`, this is not guaranteed\n for all implementations of the `Coroutine` trait.\n"
