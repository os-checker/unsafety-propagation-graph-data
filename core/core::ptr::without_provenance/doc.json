  "doc": " Creates a pointer with the given address and no [provenance][crate::ptr#provenance].\n\n This is equivalent to `ptr::null().with_addr(addr)`.\n\n Without provenance, this pointer is not associated with any actual allocation. Such a\n no-provenance pointer may be used for zero-sized memory accesses (if suitably aligned), but\n non-zero-sized memory accesses with a no-provenance pointer are UB. No-provenance pointers are\n little more than a `usize` address in disguise.\n\n This is different from `addr as *const T`, which creates a pointer that picks up a previously\n exposed provenance. See [`with_exposed_provenance`] for more details on that operation.\n\n This is a [Strict Provenance][crate::ptr#strict-provenance] API.\n"
