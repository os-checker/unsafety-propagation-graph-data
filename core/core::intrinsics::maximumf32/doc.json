  "doc": " Returns the maximum of two `f32` values, propagating NaN.\n\n This behaves like IEEE 754-2019 maximum. In particular:\n If one of the arguments is NaN, then a NaN is returned using the usual NaN propagation rules.\n For this operation, -0.0 is considered to be strictly less than +0.0.\n\n Note that, unlike most intrinsics, this is safe to call;\n it does not require an `unsafe` block.\n Therefore, implementations must not require the user to uphold\n any safety invariants.\n"
