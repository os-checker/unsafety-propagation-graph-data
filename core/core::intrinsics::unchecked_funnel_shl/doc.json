  "doc": " Funnel Shift left.\n\n Concatenates `a` and `b` (with `a` in the most significant half),\n creating an integer twice as wide. Then shift this integer left\n by `shift`), and extract the most significant half. If `a` and `b`\n are the same, this is equivalent to a rotate left operation.\n\n It is undefined behavior if `shift` is greater than or equal to the\n bit size of `T`.\n\n Safe versions of this intrinsic are available on the integer primitives\n via the `funnel_shl` method. For example, [`u32::funnel_shl`].\n"
