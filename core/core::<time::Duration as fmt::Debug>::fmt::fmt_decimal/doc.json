So\n `integer_part` = 3, `fractional_part` = 12 and `divisor` = 100\n represents the number `3.012`. Trailing zeros are omitted.\n\n `divisor` must not be above 100_000_000. It also should be a power\n of 10, everything else doesn't make sense. `fractional_part` has\n to be less than `10 * divisor`!\n\n A prefix and postfix may be added. The whole thing is padded\n to the formatter's `width`, if specified.\n"
