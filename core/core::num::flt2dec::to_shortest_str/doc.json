  "doc": " Formats the given floating point number into the decimal form with at least\n given number of fractional digits. The result is stored to the supplied parts\n array while utilizing given byte buffer as a scratch. `upper` is currently\n unused but left for the future decision to change the case of non-finite values,\n i.e., `inf` and `nan`. The first part to be rendered is always a `Part::Sign`\n (which can be an empty string if no sign is rendered).\n\n `format_shortest` should be the underlying digit-generation function.\n It should return the part of the buffer that it initialized.\n You probably would want `strategy::grisu::format_shortest` for this.\n\n `frac_digits` can be less than the number of actual fractional digits in `v`;\n it will be ignored and full digits will be printed. It is only used to print\n additional zeroes after rendered digits. Thus `frac_digits` of 0 means that\n it will only print given digits and nothing else.\n\n The byte buffer should be at least `MAX_SIG_DIGITS` bytes long.\n There should be at least 4 parts available, due to the worst case like\n `[+][0.][0000][2][0000]` with `frac_digits = 10`.\n"
