The\n coroutine will continue executing until it either yields or returns, at\n which point this function will return.\n\n # Return value\n\n The `CoroutineState` enum returned from this function indicates what\n state the coroutine is in upon returning. If the `Yielded` variant is\n returned then the coroutine has reached a suspension point and a value\n has been yielded out. Coroutines in this state are available for\n resumption at a later point.\n\n If `Complete` is returned then the coroutine has completely finished\n with the value provided. It is invalid for the coroutine to be resumed\n again.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function may panic if it is called after the `Complete` variant has\n been returned previously. While coroutine literals in the language are\n guaranteed to panic on resuming after `Complete`, this is not guaranteed\n for all implementations of the `Coroutine` trait.\n",
