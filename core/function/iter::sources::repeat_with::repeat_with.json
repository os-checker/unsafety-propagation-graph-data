  "doc": " Creates a new iterator that repeats elements of type `A` endlessly by\n applying the provided closure, the repeater, `F: FnMut() -> A`.\n\n The `repeat_with()` function calls the repeater over and over again.\n\n Infinite iterators like `repeat_with()` are often used with adapters like\n [`Iterator::take()`], in order to make them finite.\n\n If the element type of the iterator you need implements [`Clone`], and\n it is OK to keep the source element in memory, you should instead use\n the [`repeat()`] function.\n\n An iterator produced by `repeat_with()` is not a [`DoubleEndedIterator`].\n If you need `repeat_with()` to return a [`DoubleEndedIterator`],\n please open a GitHub issue explaining your use case.\n\n [`repeat()`]: crate::iter::repeat\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::iter;\n\n // let's assume we have some value of a type that is not `Clone`\n // or which we don't want to have in memory just yet because it is expensive:\n #[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]\n struct Expensive;\n\n // a particular value forever:\n let mut things = iter::repeat_with(|| Expensive);\n\n assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(Expensive), things.next());\n ```\n\n Using mutation and going finite:\n\n ```rust\n use std::iter;\n\n // From the zeroth to the third power of two:\n let mut curr = 1;\n let mut pow2 = iter::repeat_with(|| { let tmp = curr; curr *= 2; tmp })\n                     .take(4);\n\n assert_eq!(Some(1), pow2.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(2), pow2.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(4), pow2.next());\n assert_eq!(Some(8), pow2.next());\n\n // ... and now we're done\n assert_eq!(None, pow2.next());\n ```\n",
