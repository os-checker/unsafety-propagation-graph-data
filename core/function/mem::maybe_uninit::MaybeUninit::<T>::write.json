For instance, `.assume_init_mut()` cannot be used to\n initialize a `MaybeUninit`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ### Correct usage of this method:\n\n ```rust\n # #![allow(unexpected_cfgs)]\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n # unsafe extern \"C\" fn initialize_buffer(buf: *mut [u8; 1024]) { unsafe { *buf = [0; 1024] } }\n # #[cfg(FALSE)]\n extern \"C\" {\n     /// Initializes *all* the bytes of the input buffer.\n     fn initialize_buffer(buf: *mut [u8; 1024]);\n }\n\n let mut buf = MaybeUninit::<[u8; 1024]>::uninit();\n\n // Initialize `buf`:\n unsafe { initialize_buffer(buf.as_mut_ptr()); }\n // Now we know that `buf` has been initialized, so we could `.assume_init()` it.\n // However, using `.assume_init()` may trigger a `memcpy` of the 1024 bytes.\n // To assert our buffer has been initialized without copying it, we upgrade\n // the `&mut MaybeUninit<[u8; 1024]>` to a `&mut [u8; 1024]`:\n let buf: &mut [u8; 1024] = unsafe {\n     // SAFETY: `buf` has been initialized.\n     buf.assume_init_mut()\n };\n\n // Now we can use `buf` as a normal slice:\n buf.sort_unstable();\n assert!(\n     buf.windows(2).all(|pair| pair[0] <= pair[1]),\n     \"buffer is sorted\",\n );\n ```\n\n ### *Incorrect* usages of this method:\n\n You cannot use `.assume_init_mut()` to initialize a value:\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut b = MaybeUninit::<bool>::uninit();\n unsafe {\n     *b.assume_init_mut() = true;\n     // We have created a (mutable) reference to an uninitialized `bool`!\n     // This is undefined behavior. ⚠️\n }\n ```\n\n For instance, you cannot [`Read`] into an uninitialized buffer:\n\n [`Read`]: ../../std/io/trait.Read.html\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::{io, mem::MaybeUninit};\n\n fn read_chunk (reader: &'_ mut dyn io::Read) -> io::Result<[u8; 64]>\n {\n     let mut buffer = MaybeUninit::<[u8; 64]>::uninit();\n     reader.read_exact(unsafe { buffer.assume_init_mut() })?;\n     //                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     // (mutable) reference to uninitialized memory!\n     // This is undefined behavior.\n     Ok(unsafe { buffer.assume_init() })\n }\n ```\n\n Nor can you use direct field access to do field-by-field gradual initialization:\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::{mem::MaybeUninit, ptr};\n\n struct Foo {\n     a: u32,\n     b: u8,\n }\n\n let foo: Foo = unsafe {\n     let mut foo = MaybeUninit::<Foo>::uninit();\n     ptr::write(&mut foo.assume_init_mut().a as *mut u32, 1337);\n     //              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     // (mutable) reference to uninitialized memory!\n     // This is undefined behavior.\n     ptr::write(&mut foo.assume_init_mut().b as *mut u8, 42);\n     //              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     // (mutable) reference to uninitialized memory!\n     // This is undefined behavior.\n     foo.assume_init()\n };\n ```\n",

Code that receives\n the mutable reference returned by this function needs to keep this in\n mind. The safety model of Rust regards leaks as safe, but they are\n usually still undesirable.

The example below\n shows a part of an implementation of a fixed sized arena that lends out\n pinned references.\n With `write`, we can avoid the need to write through a raw pointer:\n\n ```rust\n use core::pin::Pin;\n use core::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n struct PinArena<T> {\n     memory: Box<[MaybeUninit<T>]>,\n     len: usize,\n }\n\n impl <T> PinArena<T> {\n     pub fn capacity(&self) -> usize {\n         self.memory.len()\n     }\n     pub fn push(&mut self, val: T) -> Pin<&mut T> {\n         if self.len >= self.capacity() {\n             panic!(\"Attempted to push to a full pin arena!\");\n         }\n         let ref_ = self.memory[self.len].write(val);\n         self.len += 1;\n         unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(ref_) }\n     }\n }\n ```\n",
