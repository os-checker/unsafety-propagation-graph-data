  "doc": " Returns a raw pointer to the slice's buffer.\n\n The caller must ensure that the slice outlives the pointer this\n function returns, or else it will end up dangling.\n\n The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to\n is never written to (except inside an `UnsafeCell`) using this pointer or any pointer\n derived from it. If you need to mutate the contents of the slice, use [`as_mut_ptr`].\n\n Modifying the container referenced by this slice may cause its buffer\n to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it invalid.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = &[1, 2, 4];\n let x_ptr = x.as_ptr();\n\n unsafe {\n     for i in 0..x.len() {\n         assert_eq!(x.get_unchecked(i), &*x_ptr.add(i));\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n [`as_mut_ptr`]: slice::as_mut_ptr\n",
