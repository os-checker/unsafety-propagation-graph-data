  "doc": " Compares raw pointers for equality.\n\n This is the same as using the `==` operator, but less generic:\n the arguments have to be `*const T` raw pointers,\n not anything that implements `PartialEq`.\n\n This can be used to compare `&T` references (which coerce to `*const T` implicitly)\n by their address rather than comparing the values they point to\n (which is what the `PartialEq for &T` implementation does).\n\n When comparing wide pointers, both the address and the metadata are tested for equality.\n However, note that comparing trait object pointers (`*const dyn Trait`) is unreliable: pointers\n to values of the same underlying type can compare inequal (because vtables are duplicated in\n multiple codegen units), and pointers to values of *different* underlying type can compare equal\n (since identical vtables can be deduplicated within a codegen unit).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let five = 5;\n let other_five = 5;\n let five_ref = &five;\n let same_five_ref = &five;\n let other_five_ref = &other_five;\n\n assert!(five_ref == same_five_ref);\n assert!(ptr::eq(five_ref, same_five_ref));\n\n assert!(five_ref == other_five_ref);\n assert!(!ptr::eq(five_ref, other_five_ref));\n ```\n\n Slices are also compared by their length (fat pointers):\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n assert!(std::ptr::eq(&a[..3], &a[..3]));\n assert!(!std::ptr::eq(&a[..2], &a[..3]));\n assert!(!std::ptr::eq(&a[0..2], &a[1..3]));\n ```\n",
