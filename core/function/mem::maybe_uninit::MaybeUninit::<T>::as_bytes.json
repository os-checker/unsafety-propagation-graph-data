      "doc": " Returns the size of a type in bytes.\n\n More specifically, this is the offset in bytes between successive elements\n in an array with that item type including alignment padding. Thus, for any\n type `T` and length `n`, `[T; n]` has a size of `n * size_of::<T>()`.\n\n In general, the size of a type is not stable across compilations, but\n specific types such as primitives are.\n\n The following table gives the size for primitives.\n\n Type | `size_of::<Type>()`\n ---- | ---------------\n () | 0\n bool | 1\n u8 | 1\n u16 | 2\n u32 | 4\n u64 | 8\n u128 | 16\n i8 | 1\n i16 | 2\n i32 | 4\n i64 | 8\n i128 | 16\n f32 | 4\n f64 | 8\n char | 4\n\n Furthermore, `usize` and `isize` have the same size.\n\n The types [`*const T`], `&T`, [`Box<T>`], [`Option<&T>`], and `Option<Box<T>>` all have\n the same size. If `T` is `Sized`, all of those types have the same size as `usize`.\n\n The mutability of a pointer does not change its size. As such, `&T` and `&mut T`\n have the same size. Likewise for `*const T` and `*mut T`.\n\n # Size of `#[repr(C)]` items\n\n The `C` representation for items has a defined layout. With this layout,\n the size of items is also stable as long as all fields have a stable size.\n\n ## Size of Structs\n\n For `struct`s, the size is determined by the following algorithm.\n\n For each field in the struct ordered by declaration order:\n\n 1. Add the size of the field.\n 2. Round up the current size to the nearest multiple of the next field's [alignment].\n\n Finally, round the size of the struct to the nearest multiple of its [alignment].\n The alignment of the struct is usually the largest alignment of all its\n fields; this can be changed with the use of `repr(align(N))`.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized structs are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n ## Size of Enums\n\n Enums that carry no data other than the discriminant have the same size as C enums\n on the platform they are compiled for.\n\n ## Size of Unions\n\n The size of a union is the size of its largest field.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized unions are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Some primitives\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<i32>());\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<f64>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<()>());\n\n // Some arrays\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<[i32; 2]>());\n assert_eq!(12, size_of::<[i32; 3]>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<[i32; 0]>());\n\n\n // Pointer size equality\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<*const i32>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Box<i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Option<&i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<Box<i32>>(), size_of::<Option<Box<i32>>>());\n ```\n\n Using `#[repr(C)]`.\n\n ```\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStruct {\n     first: u8,\n     second: u16,\n     third: u8\n }\n\n // The size of the first field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 1.\n // The alignment of the second field is 2, so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 2.\n // The size of the second field is 2, so add 2 to the size. Size is 4.\n // The alignment of the third field is 1, so add 0 to the size for padding. Size is 4.\n // The size of the third field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 5.\n // Finally, the alignment of the struct is 2 (because the largest alignment amongst its\n // fields is 2), so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 6.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<FieldStruct>());\n\n #[repr(C)]\n struct TupleStruct(u8, u16, u8);\n\n // Tuple structs follow the same rules.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<TupleStruct>());\n\n // Note that reordering the fields can lower the size. We can remove both padding bytes\n // by putting `third` before `second`.\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStructOptimized {\n     first: u8,\n     third: u8,\n     second: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<FieldStructOptimized>());\n\n // Union size is the size of the largest field.\n #[repr(C)]\n union ExampleUnion {\n     smaller: u8,\n     larger: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(2, size_of::<ExampleUnion>());\n ```\n\n [alignment]: align_of\n [`*const T`]: primitive@pointer\n [`Box<T>`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html\n [`Option<&T>`]: crate::option::Option\n\n",

      "doc": " Forms a slice from a pointer and a length.\n\n The `len` argument is the number of **elements**, not the number of bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `data` must be non-null, [valid] for reads for `len * size_of::<T>()` many bytes,\n   and it must be properly aligned. This means in particular:\n\n     * The entire memory range of this slice must be contained within a single allocation!\n       Slices can never span across multiple allocations. See [below](#incorrect-usage)\n       for an example incorrectly not taking this into account.\n     * `data` must be non-null and aligned even for zero-length slices or slices of ZSTs. One\n       reason for this is that enum layout optimizations may rely on references\n       (including slices of any length) being aligned and non-null to distinguish\n       them from other data. You can obtain a pointer that is usable as `data`\n       for zero-length slices using [`NonNull::dangling()`].\n\n * `data` must point to `len` consecutive properly initialized values of type `T`.\n\n * The memory referenced by the returned slice must not be mutated for the duration\n   of lifetime `'a`, except inside an `UnsafeCell`.\n\n * The total size `len * size_of::<T>()` of the slice must be no larger than `isize::MAX`,\n   and adding that size to `data` must not \"wrap around\" the address space.\n   See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].\n\n # Caveat\n\n The lifetime for the returned slice is inferred from its usage. To\n prevent accidental misuse, it's suggested to tie the lifetime to whichever\n source lifetime is safe in the context, such as by providing a helper\n function taking the lifetime of a host value for the slice, or by explicit\n annotation.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::slice;\n\n // manifest a slice for a single element\n let x = 42;\n let ptr = &x as *const _;\n let slice = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, 1) };\n assert_eq!(slice[0], 42);\n ```\n\n ### Incorrect usage\n\n The following `join_slices` function is **unsound** ⚠️\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::slice;\n\n fn join_slices<'a, T>(fst: &'a [T], snd: &'a [T]) -> &'a [T] {\n     let fst_end = fst.as_ptr().wrapping_add(fst.len());\n     let snd_start = snd.as_ptr();\n     assert_eq!(fst_end, snd_start, \"Slices must be contiguous!\");\n     unsafe {\n         // The assertion above ensures `fst` and `snd` are contiguous, but they might\n         // still be contained within _different allocations_, in which case\n         // creating this slice is undefined behavior.\n         slice::from_raw_parts(fst.as_ptr(), fst.len() + snd.len())\n     }\n }\n\n fn main() {\n     // `a` and `b` are different allocations...\n     let a = 42;\n     let b = 27;\n     // ... which may nevertheless be laid out contiguously in memory: | a | b |\n     let _ = join_slices(slice::from_ref(&a), slice::from_ref(&b)); // UB\n }\n ```\n\n ### FFI: Handling null pointers\n\n In languages such as C++, pointers to empty collections are not guaranteed to be non-null.\n When accepting such pointers, they have to be checked for null-ness to avoid undefined\n behavior.\n\n ```\n use std::slice;\n\n /// Sum the elements of an FFI slice.\n ///\n /// # Safety\n ///\n /// If ptr is not NULL, it must be correctly aligned and\n /// point to `len` initialized items of type `f32`.\n unsafe extern \"C\" fn sum_slice(ptr: *const f32, len: usize) -> f32 {\n     let data = if ptr.is_null() {\n         // `len` is assumed to be 0.\n         &[]\n     } else {\n         // SAFETY: see function docstring.\n         unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len) }\n     };\n     data.into_iter().sum()\n }\n\n // This could be the result of C++'s std::vector::data():\n let ptr = std::ptr::null();\n // And this could be std::vector::size():\n let len = 0;\n assert_eq!(unsafe { sum_slice(ptr, len) }, 0.0);\n ```\n\n [valid]: ptr#safety\n [`NonNull::dangling()`]: ptr::NonNull::dangling\n",
