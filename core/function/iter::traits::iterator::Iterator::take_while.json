  "doc": " Creates an iterator that yields elements based on a predicate.\n\n `take_while()` takes a closure as an argument. It will call this\n closure on each element of the iterator, and yield elements\n while it returns `true`.\n\n After `false` is returned, `take_while()`'s job is over, and the\n rest of the elements are ignored.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [-1i32, 0, 1];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().take_while(|x| x.is_negative());\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(-1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n Because the closure passed to `take_while()` takes a reference, and many\n iterators iterate over references, this leads to a possibly confusing\n situation, where the type of the closure is a double reference:\n\n ```\n let s = &[-1, 0, 1];\n\n let mut iter = s.iter().take_while(|x| **x < 0); // need two *s!\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&-1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n Stopping after an initial `false`:\n\n ```\n let a = [-1, 0, 1, -2];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter().take_while(|&x| x < 0);\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(-1));\n\n // We have more elements that are less than zero, but since we already\n // got a false, take_while() ignores the remaining elements.\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n Because `take_while()` needs to look at the value in order to see if it\n should be included or not, consuming iterators will see that it is\n removed:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n let mut iter = a.into_iter();\n\n let result: Vec<i32> = iter.by_ref().take_while(|&n| n != 3).collect();\n\n assert_eq!(result, [1, 2]);\n\n let result: Vec<i32> = iter.collect();\n\n assert_eq!(result, [4]);\n ```\n\n The `3` is no longer there, because it was consumed in order to see if\n the iteration should stop, but wasn't placed back into the iterator.\n",
