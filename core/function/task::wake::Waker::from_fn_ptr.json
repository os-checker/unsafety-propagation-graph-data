This could be e.g. a type-erased pointer to an `Arc`\n that is associated with the task.\n The value of this pointer will get passed to all functions that are part\n of the `vtable` as the first parameter.\n\n It is important to consider that the `data` pointer must point to a\n thread safe type such as an `Arc<T: Send + Sync>`\n when used to construct a [`Waker`]. This restriction is lifted when\n constructing a [`LocalWaker`], which allows using types that do not implement\n <code>[Send] + [Sync]</code> like `Rc<T>`.\n\n The `vtable` customizes the behavior of a `Waker` which gets created\n from a `RawWaker`. For each operation on the `Waker`, the associated\n function in the `vtable` of the underlying `RawWaker` will be called.\n",
