The source\n and destination may overlap.\n\n If the source and destination will *never* overlap,\n [`copy_nonoverlapping`] can be used instead.\n\n `copy` is semantically equivalent to C's [`memmove`], but\n with the source and destination arguments swapped,\n and `count` counting the number of `T`s instead of bytes.\n Copying takes place as if the bytes were copied from `src`\n to a temporary array and then copied from the array to `dst`.\n\n The copy is \"untyped\" in the sense that data may be uninitialized or otherwise violate the\n requirements of `T`. The initialization state is preserved exactly.\n\n [`memmove`]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/memmove\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `src` must be [valid] for reads of `count * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n * `dst` must be [valid] for writes of `count * size_of::<T>()` bytes, and must remain valid even\n   when `src` is read for `count * size_of::<T>()` bytes. (This means if the memory ranges\n   overlap, the `dst` pointer must not be invalidated by `src` reads.)\n\n * Both `src` and `dst` must be properly aligned.\n\n Like [`read`], `copy` creates a bitwise copy of `T`, regardless of\n whether `T` is [`Copy`]. If `T` is not [`Copy`], using both the values\n in the region beginning at `*src` and the region beginning at `*dst` can\n [violate memory safety][read-ownership].\n\n Note that even if the effectively copied size (`count * size_of::<T>()`) is\n `0`, the pointers must be properly aligned.\n\n [`read`]: crate::ptr::read\n [read-ownership]: crate::ptr::read#ownership-of-the-returned-value\n [valid]: crate::ptr#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Efficiently create a Rust vector from an unsafe buffer:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n /// # Safety\n ///\n /// * `ptr` must be correctly aligned for its type and non-zero.\n /// * `ptr` must be valid for reads of `elts` contiguous elements of type `T`.\n /// * Those elements must not be used after calling this function unless `T: Copy`.\n # #[allow(dead_code)]\n unsafe fn from_buf_raw<T>(ptr: *const T, elts: usize) -> Vec<T> {\n     let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(elts);\n\n     // SAFETY: Our precondition ensures the source is aligned and valid,\n     // and `Vec::with_capacity` ensures that we have usable space to write them.\n     unsafe { ptr::copy(ptr, dst.as_mut_ptr(), elts); }\n\n     // SAFETY: We created it with this much capacity earlier,\n     // and the previous `copy` has initialized these elements.\n     unsafe { dst.set_len(elts); }\n     dst\n }\n ```\n",
