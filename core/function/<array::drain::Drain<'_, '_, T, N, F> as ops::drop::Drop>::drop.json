The returned value is in\n units of T: the distance in bytes is divided by `size_of::<T>()`.\n\n This computes the same value that [`offset_from`](#method.offset_from)\n would compute, but with the added precondition that the offset is\n guaranteed to be non-negative.  This method is equivalent to\n `usize::try_from(self.offset_from(origin)).unwrap_unchecked()`,\n but it provides slightly more information to the optimizer, which can\n sometimes allow it to optimize slightly better with some backends.\n\n This method can be thought of as recovering the `count` that was passed\n to [`add`](#method.add) (or, with the parameters in the other order,\n to [`sub`](#method.sub)).  The following are all equivalent, assuming\n that their safety preconditions are met:\n ```rust\n # unsafe fn blah(ptr: *mut i32, origin: *mut i32, count: usize) -> bool { unsafe {\n ptr.offset_from_unsigned(origin) == count\n # &&\n origin.add(count) == ptr\n # &&\n ptr.sub(count) == origin\n # } }\n ```\n\n # Safety\n\n - The distance between the pointers must be non-negative (`self >= origin`)\n\n - *All* the safety conditions of [`offset_from`](#method.offset_from)\n   apply to this method as well; see it for the full details.\n\n Importantly, despite the return type of this method being able to represent\n a larger offset, it's still *not permitted* to pass pointers which differ\n by more than `isize::MAX` *bytes*.  As such, the result of this method will\n always be less than or equal to `isize::MAX as usize`.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function panics if `T` is a Zero-Sized Type (\"ZST\").\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut a = [0; 5];\n let p: *mut i32 = a.as_mut_ptr();\n unsafe {\n     let ptr1: *mut i32 = p.add(1);\n     let ptr2: *mut i32 = p.add(3);\n\n     assert_eq!(ptr2.offset_from_unsigned(ptr1), 2);\n     assert_eq!(ptr1.add(2), ptr2);\n     assert_eq!(ptr2.sub(2), ptr1);\n     assert_eq!(ptr2.offset_from_unsigned(ptr2), 0);\n }\n\n // This would be incorrect, as the pointers are not correctly ordered:\n // ptr1.offset_from(ptr2)\n ```\n",

For packed structs, this move is\n done automatically by the compiler. This means the fields of packed structs\n are not dropped in-place.\n\n [`ptr::read`]: self::read\n [`ptr::read_unaligned`]: self::read_unaligned\n [pinned]: crate::pin\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `to_drop` must be [valid] for both reads and writes.\n\n * `to_drop` must be properly aligned, even if `T` has size 0.\n\n * `to_drop` must be nonnull, even if `T` has size 0.\n\n * The value `to_drop` points to must be valid for dropping, which may mean\n   it must uphold additional invariants. These invariants depend on the type\n   of the value being dropped. For instance, when dropping a Box, the box's\n   pointer to the heap must be valid.\n\n * While `drop_in_place` is executing, the only way to access parts of\n   `to_drop` is through the `&mut self` references supplied to the\n   `Drop::drop` methods that `drop_in_place` invokes.\n\n Additionally, if `T` is not [`Copy`], using the pointed-to value after\n calling `drop_in_place` can cause undefined behavior. Note that `*to_drop =\n foo` counts as a use because it will cause the value to be dropped\n again. [`write()`] can be used to overwrite data without causing it to be\n dropped.\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Manually remove the last item from a vector:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n use std::rc::Rc;\n\n let last = Rc::new(1);\n let weak = Rc::downgrade(&last);\n\n let mut v = vec![Rc::new(0), last];\n\n unsafe {\n     // Get a raw pointer to the last element in `v`.\n     let ptr = &mut v[1] as *mut _;\n     // Shorten `v` to prevent the last item from being dropped. We do that first,\n     // to prevent issues if the `drop_in_place` below panics.\n     v.set_len(1);\n     // Without a call `drop_in_place`, the last item would never be dropped,\n     // and the memory it manages would be leaked.\n     ptr::drop_in_place(ptr);\n }\n\n assert_eq!(v, &[0.into()]);\n\n // Ensure that the last item was dropped.\n assert!(weak.upgrade().is_none());\n ```\n",
