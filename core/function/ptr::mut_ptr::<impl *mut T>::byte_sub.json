If you need to move forward or\n backward depending on the value, then you might want [`offset`](#method.offset) instead\n which takes a signed offset.\n\n `count` is in units of T; e.g., a `count` of 3 represents a pointer\n offset of `3 * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n If any of the following conditions are violated, the result is Undefined Behavior:\n\n * The offset in bytes, `count * size_of::<T>()`, computed on mathematical integers (without\n   \"wrapping around\"), must fit in an `isize`.\n\n * If the computed offset is non-zero, then `self` must be [derived from][crate::ptr#provenance] a pointer to some\n   [allocation], and the entire memory range between `self` and the result must be in\n   bounds of that allocation. In particular, this range must not \"wrap around\" the edge\n   of the address space.\n\n Allocations can never be larger than `isize::MAX` bytes, so if the computed offset\n stays in bounds of the allocation, it is guaranteed to satisfy the first requirement.\n This implies, for instance, that `vec.as_ptr().add(vec.len())` (for `vec: Vec<T>`) is always\n safe.\n\n Consider using [`wrapping_sub`] instead if these constraints are\n difficult to satisfy. The only advantage of this method is that it\n enables more aggressive compiler optimizations.\n\n [`wrapping_sub`]: #method.wrapping_sub\n [allocation]: crate::ptr#allocation\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s: &str = \"123\";\n\n unsafe {\n     let end: *const u8 = s.as_ptr().add(3);\n     assert_eq!('3', *end.sub(1) as char);\n     assert_eq!('2', *end.sub(2) as char);\n }\n ```\n",

For pointers to an unsized type (fat pointers) this recombines the address\n with new metadata such as slice lengths or `dyn`-vtable.\n\n The resulting pointer will have provenance of `self`.

The pointer is cast to a sized pointee to utilize offset operations and then\n recombined with its own original metadata.\n\n ```\n #![feature(set_ptr_value)]\n # use core::fmt::Debug;\n let mut arr: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut ptr = arr.as_mut_ptr() as *mut dyn Debug;\n let thin = ptr as *mut u8;\n unsafe {\n     ptr = thin.add(8).with_metadata_of(ptr);\n     # assert_eq!(*(ptr as *mut i32), 3);\n     println!(\"{:?}\", &*ptr); // will print \"3\"\n }\n ```\n\n # *Incorrect* usage\n\n The provenance from pointers is *not* combined. The result must only be used to refer to the\n address allowed by `self`.\n\n ```rust,no_run\n #![feature(set_ptr_value)]\n let mut x = 0u32;\n let mut y = 1u32;\n\n let x = (&mut x) as *mut u32;\n let y = (&mut y) as *mut u32;\n\n let offset = (x as usize - y as usize) / 4;\n let bad = x.wrapping_add(offset).with_metadata_of(y);\n\n // This dereference is UB.
