      "doc": " Returns the size of a type in bytes.\n\n More specifically, this is the offset in bytes between successive elements\n in an array with that item type including alignment padding. Thus, for any\n type `T` and length `n`, `[T; n]` has a size of `n * size_of::<T>()`.\n\n In general, the size of a type is not stable across compilations, but\n specific types such as primitives are.\n\n The following table gives the size for primitives.\n\n Type | `size_of::<Type>()`\n ---- | ---------------\n () | 0\n bool | 1\n u8 | 1\n u16 | 2\n u32 | 4\n u64 | 8\n u128 | 16\n i8 | 1\n i16 | 2\n i32 | 4\n i64 | 8\n i128 | 16\n f32 | 4\n f64 | 8\n char | 4\n\n Furthermore, `usize` and `isize` have the same size.\n\n The types [`*const T`], `&T`, [`Box<T>`], [`Option<&T>`], and `Option<Box<T>>` all have\n the same size. If `T` is `Sized`, all of those types have the same size as `usize`.\n\n The mutability of a pointer does not change its size. As such, `&T` and `&mut T`\n have the same size. Likewise for `*const T` and `*mut T`.\n\n # Size of `#[repr(C)]` items\n\n The `C` representation for items has a defined layout. With this layout,\n the size of items is also stable as long as all fields have a stable size.\n\n ## Size of Structs\n\n For `struct`s, the size is determined by the following algorithm.\n\n For each field in the struct ordered by declaration order:\n\n 1. Add the size of the field.\n 2. Round up the current size to the nearest multiple of the next field's [alignment].\n\n Finally, round the size of the struct to the nearest multiple of its [alignment].\n The alignment of the struct is usually the largest alignment of all its\n fields; this can be changed with the use of `repr(align(N))`.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized structs are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n ## Size of Enums\n\n Enums that carry no data other than the discriminant have the same size as C enums\n on the platform they are compiled for.\n\n ## Size of Unions\n\n The size of a union is the size of its largest field.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized unions are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Some primitives\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<i32>());\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<f64>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<()>());\n\n // Some arrays\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<[i32; 2]>());\n assert_eq!(12, size_of::<[i32; 3]>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<[i32; 0]>());\n\n\n // Pointer size equality\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<*const i32>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Box<i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Option<&i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<Box<i32>>(), size_of::<Option<Box<i32>>>());\n ```\n\n Using `#[repr(C)]`.\n\n ```\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStruct {\n     first: u8,\n     second: u16,\n     third: u8\n }\n\n // The size of the first field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 1.\n // The alignment of the second field is 2, so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 2.\n // The size of the second field is 2, so add 2 to the size. Size is 4.\n // The alignment of the third field is 1, so add 0 to the size for padding. Size is 4.\n // The size of the third field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 5.\n // Finally, the alignment of the struct is 2 (because the largest alignment amongst its\n // fields is 2), so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 6.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<FieldStruct>());\n\n #[repr(C)]\n struct TupleStruct(u8, u16, u8);\n\n // Tuple structs follow the same rules.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<TupleStruct>());\n\n // Note that reordering the fields can lower the size. We can remove both padding bytes\n // by putting `third` before `second`.\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStructOptimized {\n     first: u8,\n     third: u8,\n     second: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<FieldStructOptimized>());\n\n // Union size is the size of the largest field.\n #[repr(C)]\n union ExampleUnion {\n     smaller: u8,\n     larger: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(2, size_of::<ExampleUnion>());\n ```\n\n [alignment]: align_of\n [`*const T`]: primitive@pointer\n [`Box<T>`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html\n [`Option<&T>`]: crate::option::Option\n\n",

      "doc": " Makes a *soundness* promise to the compiler that `cond` holds.\n\n This may allow the optimizer to simplify things, but it might also make the generated code\n slower. Either way, calling it will most likely make compilation take longer.\n\n You may know this from other places as\n [`llvm.assume`](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-assume-intrinsic) or, in C,\n [`__builtin_assume`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#builtin-assume).\n\n This promotes a correctness requirement to a soundness requirement. Don't do that without\n very good reason.\n\n # Usage\n\n This is a situational tool for micro-optimization, and is allowed to do nothing. Any use\n should come with a repeatable benchmark to show the value, with the expectation to drop it\n later should the optimizer get smarter and no longer need it.\n\n The more complicated the condition, the less likely this is to be useful. For example,\n `assert_unchecked(foo.is_sorted())` is a complex enough value that the compiler is unlikely\n to be able to take advantage of it.\n\n There's also no need to `assert_unchecked` basic properties of things.  For example, the\n compiler already knows the range of `count_ones`, so there is no benefit to\n `let n = u32::count_ones(x); assert_unchecked(n <= u32::BITS);`.\n\n `assert_unchecked` is logically equivalent to `if !cond { unreachable_unchecked(); }`. If\n ever you are tempted to write `assert_unchecked(false)`, you should instead use\n [`unreachable_unchecked()`] directly.\n\n # Safety\n\n `cond` must be `true`. It is immediate UB to call this with `false`.\n\n # Example\n\n ```\n use core::hint;\n\n /// # Safety\n ///\n /// `p` must be nonnull and valid\n pub unsafe fn next_value(p: *const i32) -> i32 {\n     // SAFETY: caller invariants guarantee that `p` is not null\n     unsafe { hint::assert_unchecked(!p.is_null()) }\n\n     if p.is_null() {\n         return -1;\n     } else {\n         // SAFETY: caller invariants guarantee that `p` is valid\n         unsafe { *p + 1 }\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n Without the `assert_unchecked`, the above function produces the following with optimizations\n enabled:\n\n ```asm\n next_value:\n         test    rdi, rdi\n         je      .LBB0_1\n         mov     eax, dword ptr [rdi]\n         inc     eax\n         ret\n .LBB0_1:\n         mov     eax, -1\n         ret\n ```\n\n Adding the assertion allows the optimizer to remove the extra check:\n\n ```asm\n next_value:\n         mov     eax, dword ptr [rdi]\n         inc     eax\n         ret\n ```\n\n This example is quite unlike anything that would be used in the real world: it is redundant\n to put an assertion right next to code that checks the same thing, and dereferencing a\n pointer already has the builtin assumption that it is nonnull. However, it illustrates the\n kind of changes the optimizer can make even when the behavior is less obviously related.\n",

Code that receives\n the mutable reference returned by this function needs to keep this in\n mind. The safety model of Rust regards leaks as safe, but they are\n usually still undesirable. This being said, the mutable reference\n behaves like any other mutable reference would, so assigning a new value\n to it will drop the old content.\n\n [`assume_init`]: Self::assume_init\n [`assume_init_drop`]: Self::assume_init_drop\n\n # Examples\n\n Correct usage of this method:\n\n ```rust\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<Vec<u8>>::uninit();\n\n {\n     let hello = x.write((&b\"Hello, world!\").to_vec());\n     // Setting hello does not leak prior allocations, but drops them\n     *hello = (&b\"Hello\").to_vec();\n     hello[0] = 'h' as u8;\n }\n // x is initialized now:\n let s = unsafe { x.assume_init() };\n assert_eq!(b\"hello\", s.as_slice());\n ```\n\n This usage of the method causes a leak:\n\n ```rust\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<String>::uninit();\n\n x.write(\"Hello\".to_string());\n # // FIXME(https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/3670):\n # // use -Zmiri-disable-leak-check instead of unleaking in tests meant to leak.\n # unsafe { MaybeUninit::assume_init_drop(&mut x); }\n // This leaks the contained string:\n x.write(\"hello\".to_string());\n // x is initialized now:\n let s = unsafe { x.assume_init() };\n ```\n\n This method can be used to avoid unsafe in some cases. The example below\n shows a part of an implementation of a fixed sized arena that lends out\n pinned references.\n With `write`, we can avoid the need to write through a raw pointer:\n\n ```rust\n use core::pin::Pin;\n use core::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n struct PinArena<T> {\n     memory: Box<[MaybeUninit<T>]>,\n     len: usize,\n }\n\n impl <T> PinArena<T> {\n     pub fn capacity(&self) -> usize {\n         self.memory.len()\n     }\n     pub fn push(&mut self, val: T) -> Pin<&mut T> {\n         if self.len >= self.capacity() {\n             panic!(\"Attempted to push to a full pin arena!\");\n         }\n         let ref_ = self.memory[self.len].write(val);\n         self.len += 1;\n         unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(ref_) }\n     }\n }\n ```\n",
