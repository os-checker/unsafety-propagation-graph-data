In particular an adapter may have consumed more elements than strictly necessary.\n\n The overall goal of these requirements is to let the consumer of a pipeline use\n * whatever remains in the source after iteration has stopped\n * the memory that has become unused by advancing a consuming iterator\n\n [`next()`]: Iterator::next()\n",
