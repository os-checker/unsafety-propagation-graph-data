      "doc": " Attempts to resolve the future to a final value, registering\n the current task for wakeup if the value is not yet available.\n\n # Return value\n\n This function returns:\n\n - [`Poll::Pending`] if the future is not ready yet\n - [`Poll::Ready(val)`] with the result `val` of this future if it\n   finished successfully.\n\n Once a future has finished, clients should not `poll` it again.\n\n When a future is not ready yet, `poll` returns `Poll::Pending` and\n stores a clone of the [`Waker`] copied from the current [`Context`].\n This [`Waker`] is then woken once the future can make progress.\n For example, a future waiting for a socket to become\n readable would call `.clone()` on the [`Waker`] and store it.\n When a signal arrives elsewhere indicating that the socket is readable,\n [`Waker::wake`] is called and the socket future's task is awoken.\n Once a task has been woken up, it should attempt to `poll` the future\n again, which may or may not produce a final value.\n\n Note that on multiple calls to `poll`, only the [`Waker`] from the\n [`Context`] passed to the most recent call should be scheduled to\n receive a wakeup.\n\n # Runtime characteristics\n\n Futures alone are *inert*; they must be *actively* `poll`ed for the\n underlying computation to make progress, meaning that each time the\n current task is woken up, it should actively re-`poll` pending futures\n that it still has an interest in.\n\n Having said that, some Futures may represent a value that is being\n computed in a different task. In this case, the future's underlying\n computation is simply acting as a conduit for a value being computed\n by that other task, which will proceed independently of the Future.\n Futures of this kind are typically obtained when spawning a new task into an\n async runtime.\n\n The `poll` function should not be called repeatedly in a tight loop --\n instead, it should only be called when the future indicates that it is\n ready to make progress (by calling `wake()`). If you're familiar with the\n `poll(2)` or `select(2)` syscalls on Unix it's worth noting that futures\n typically do *not* suffer the same problems of \"all wakeups must poll\n all events\"; they are more like `epoll(4)`.\n\n An implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and should\n not block. Returning quickly prevents unnecessarily clogging up\n threads or event loops. If it is known ahead of time that a call to\n `poll` may end up taking a while, the work should be offloaded to a\n thread pool (or something similar) to ensure that `poll` can return\n quickly.\n\n # Panics\n\n Once a future has completed (returned `Ready` from `poll`), calling its\n `poll` method again may panic, block forever, or cause other kinds of\n problems; the `Future` trait places no requirements on the effects of\n such a call. However, as the `poll` method is not marked `unsafe`,\n Rust's usual rules apply: calls must never cause undefined behavior\n (memory corruption, incorrect use of `unsafe` functions, or the like),\n regardless of the future's state.\n\n [`Poll::Ready(val)`]: Poll::Ready\n [`Waker`]: crate::task::Waker\n [`Waker::wake`]: crate::task::Waker::wake\n",
