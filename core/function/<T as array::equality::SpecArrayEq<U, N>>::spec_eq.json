It will be used for its size and alignment,\n but any validity restrictions will be ignored, not enforced.\n\n # Safety\n\n It's UB to call this if any of the *bytes* in `*a` or `*b` are uninitialized.\n Note that this is a stricter criterion than just the *values* being\n fully-initialized: if `T` has padding, it's UB to call this intrinsic.\n\n At compile-time, it is furthermore UB to call this if any of the bytes\n in `*a` or `*b` have provenance.\n\n (The implementation is allowed to branch on the results of comparisons,\n which is UB if any of their inputs are `undef`.)\n",
