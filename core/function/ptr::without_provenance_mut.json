No-provenance pointers are\n little more than a `usize` address in disguise.\n\n This is different from `addr as *mut T`, which creates a pointer that picks up a previously\n exposed provenance. See [`with_exposed_provenance_mut`] for more details on that operation.\n\n This is a [Strict Provenance][crate::ptr#strict-provenance] API.\n",
