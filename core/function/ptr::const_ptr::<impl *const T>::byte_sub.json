If you need to move forward or\n backward depending on the value, then you might want [`offset`](#method.offset) instead\n which takes a signed offset.\n\n `count` is in units of T; e.g., a `count` of 3 represents a pointer\n offset of `3 * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n If any of the following conditions are violated, the result is Undefined Behavior:\n\n * The offset in bytes, `count * size_of::<T>()`, computed on mathematical integers (without\n   \"wrapping around\"), must fit in an `isize`.\n\n * If the computed offset is non-zero, then `self` must be [derived from][crate::ptr#provenance] a pointer to some\n   [allocation], and the entire memory range between `self` and the result must be in\n   bounds of that allocation. In particular, this range must not \"wrap around\" the edge\n   of the address space.\n\n Allocations can never be larger than `isize::MAX` bytes, so if the computed offset\n stays in bounds of the allocation, it is guaranteed to satisfy the first requirement.\n This implies, for instance, that `vec.as_ptr().add(vec.len())` (for `vec: Vec<T>`) is always\n safe.\n\n Consider using [`wrapping_sub`] instead if these constraints are\n difficult to satisfy. The only advantage of this method is that it\n enables more aggressive compiler optimizations.\n\n [`wrapping_sub`]: #method.wrapping_sub\n [allocation]: crate::ptr#allocation\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s: &str = \"123\";\n\n unsafe {\n     let end: *const u8 = s.as_ptr().add(3);\n     assert_eq!(*end.sub(1), b'3');\n     assert_eq!(*end.sub(2), b'2');\n }\n ```\n",

For pointers to an unsized type (fat pointers) this recombines the address\n with new metadata such as slice lengths or `dyn`-vtable.\n\n The resulting pointer will have provenance of `self`.
