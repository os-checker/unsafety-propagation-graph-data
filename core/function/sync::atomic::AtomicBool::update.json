The\n return value is a result indicating whether the new value was written and containing the\n previous value.\n\n `compare_exchange_weak` takes two [`Ordering`] arguments to describe the memory\n ordering of this operation. `success` describes the required ordering for the\n read-modify-write operation that takes place if the comparison with `current` succeeds.\n `failure` describes the required ordering for the load operation that takes place when\n the comparison fails. Using [`Acquire`] as success ordering makes the store part\n of this operation [`Relaxed`], and using [`Release`] makes the successful load\n [`Relaxed`]. The failure ordering can only be [`SeqCst`], [`Acquire`] or [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note:** This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on `u8`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\n let val = AtomicBool::new(false);\n\n let new = true;\n let mut old = val.load(Ordering::Relaxed);\n loop {\n     match val.compare_exchange_weak(old, new, Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::Relaxed) {\n         Ok(_) => break,\n         Err(x) => old = x,\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n # Considerations\n\n `compare_exchange` is a [compare-and-swap operation] and thus exhibits the usual downsides\n of CAS operations. In particular, a load of the value followed by a successful\n `compare_exchange` with the previous load *does not ensure* that other threads have not\n changed the value in the interim. This is usually important when the *equality* check in\n the `compare_exchange` is being used to check the *identity* of a value, but equality\n does not necessarily imply identity. In this case, `compare_exchange` can lead to the\n [ABA problem].\n\n [ABA Problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem\n [compare-and-swap operation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap\n",
