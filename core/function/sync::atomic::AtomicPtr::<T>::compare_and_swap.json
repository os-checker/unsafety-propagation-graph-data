On success this value is guaranteed to be equal to `current`.\n\n `compare_exchange` takes two [`Ordering`] arguments to describe the memory\n ordering of this operation. `success` describes the required ordering for the\n read-modify-write operation that takes place if the comparison with `current` succeeds.\n `failure` describes the required ordering for the load operation that takes place when\n the comparison fails. Using [`Acquire`] as success ordering makes the store part\n of this operation [`Relaxed`], and using [`Release`] makes the successful load\n [`Relaxed`]. The failure ordering can only be [`SeqCst`], [`Acquire`] or [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note:** This method is only available on platforms that support atomic\n operations on pointers.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering};\n\n let ptr = &mut 5;\n let some_ptr = AtomicPtr::new(ptr);\n\n let other_ptr = &mut 10;\n\n let value = some_ptr.compare_exchange(ptr, other_ptr,\n                                       Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::Relaxed);\n ```\n\n # Considerations\n\n `compare_exchange` is a [compare-and-swap operation] and thus exhibits the usual downsides\n of CAS operations. In particular, a load of the value followed by a successful\n `compare_exchange` with the previous load *does not ensure* that other threads have not\n changed the value in the interim. This is usually important when the *equality* check in\n the `compare_exchange` is being used to check the *identity* of a value, but equality\n does not necessarily imply identity. This is a particularly common case for pointers, as\n a pointer holding the same address does not imply that the same object exists at that\n address! In this case, `compare_exchange` can lead to the [ABA problem].\n\n [ABA Problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem\n [compare-and-swap operation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap\n",
