Out-of-bounds result lead to UB.\n When casting integers to floats, the result is rounded.\n Otherwise, truncates or extends the value, maintaining the sign for signed integers.\n\n # Safety\n Casting from integer types is always safe.\n Casting between two float types is also always safe.\n\n Casting floats to integers truncates, following the same rules as `to_int_unchecked`.\n Specifically, each element must:\n * Not be `NaN`\n * Not be infinite\n * Be representable in the return type, after truncating off its fractional part\n",
