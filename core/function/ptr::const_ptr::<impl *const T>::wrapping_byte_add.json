[`add`]\n can be optimized better and is thus preferable in performance-sensitive code.\n\n The delayed check only considers the value of the pointer that was dereferenced, not the\n intermediate values used during the computation of the final result. For example,\n `x.wrapping_add(o).wrapping_sub(o)` is always the same as `x`. In other words, leaving the\n allocation and then re-entering it later is permitted.\n\n [`add`]: #method.add\n [allocation]: crate::ptr#allocation\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n # use std::fmt::Write;\n // Iterate using a raw pointer in increments of two elements\n let data = [1u8, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n let mut ptr: *const u8 = data.as_ptr();\n let step = 2;\n let end_rounded_up = ptr.wrapping_add(6);\n\n let mut out = String::new();\n while ptr != end_rounded_up {\n     unsafe {\n         write!(&mut out, \"{}, \", *ptr)?;\n     }\n     ptr = ptr.wrapping_add(step);\n }\n assert_eq!(out, \"1, 3, 5, \");\n # std::fmt::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n",

      "doc": " Uses the address value in a new pointer of another type.\n\n This operation will ignore the address part of its `meta` operand and discard existing\n metadata of `self`. For pointers to a sized types (thin pointers), this has the same effect\n as a simple cast. For pointers to an unsized type (fat pointers) this recombines the address\n with new metadata such as slice lengths or `dyn`-vtable.\n\n The resulting pointer will have provenance of `self`. This operation is semantically the\n same as creating a new pointer with the data pointer value of `self` but the metadata of\n `meta`, being fat or thin depending on the `meta` operand.\n\n # Examples\n\n This function is primarily useful for enabling pointer arithmetic on potentially fat\n pointers. The pointer is cast to a sized pointee to utilize offset operations and then\n recombined with its own original metadata.\n\n ```\n #![feature(set_ptr_value)]\n # use core::fmt::Debug;\n let arr: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];\n let mut ptr = arr.as_ptr() as *const dyn Debug;\n let thin = ptr as *const u8;\n unsafe {\n     ptr = thin.add(8).with_metadata_of(ptr);\n     # assert_eq!(*(ptr as *const i32), 3);\n     println!(\"{:?}\", &*ptr); // will print \"3\"\n }\n ```\n\n # *Incorrect* usage\n\n The provenance from pointers is *not* combined. The result must only be used to refer to the\n address allowed by `self`.\n\n ```rust,no_run\n #![feature(set_ptr_value)]\n let x = 0u32;\n let y = 1u32;\n\n let x = (&x) as *const u32;\n let y = (&y) as *const u32;\n\n let offset = (x as usize - y as usize) / 4;\n let bad = x.wrapping_add(offset).with_metadata_of(y);\n\n // This dereference is UB.
