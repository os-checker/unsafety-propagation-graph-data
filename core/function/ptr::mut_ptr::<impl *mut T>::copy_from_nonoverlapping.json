The source\n and destination must *not* overlap.\n\n For regions of memory which might overlap, use [`copy`] instead.\n\n `copy_nonoverlapping` is semantically equivalent to C's [`memcpy`], but\n with the source and destination arguments swapped,\n and `count` counting the number of `T`s instead of bytes.\n\n The copy is \"untyped\" in the sense that data may be uninitialized or otherwise violate the\n requirements of `T`. The initialization state is preserved exactly.\n\n [`memcpy`]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/memcpy\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `src` must be [valid] for reads of `count * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n * `dst` must be [valid] for writes of `count * size_of::<T>()` bytes.\n\n * Both `src` and `dst` must be properly aligned.\n\n * The region of memory beginning at `src` with a size of `count *\n   size_of::<T>()` bytes must *not* overlap with the region of memory\n   beginning at `dst` with the same size.\n\n Like [`read`], `copy_nonoverlapping` creates a bitwise copy of `T`, regardless of\n whether `T` is [`Copy`]. If `T` is not [`Copy`], using *both* the values\n in the region beginning at `*src` and the region beginning at `*dst` can\n [violate memory safety][read-ownership].\n\n Note that even if the effectively copied size (`count * size_of::<T>()`) is\n `0`, the pointers must be properly aligned.\n\n [`read`]: crate::ptr::read\n [read-ownership]: crate::ptr::read#ownership-of-the-returned-value\n [valid]: crate::ptr#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Manually implement [`Vec::append`]:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n /// Moves all the elements of `src` into `dst`, leaving `src` empty.\n fn append<T>(dst: &mut Vec<T>, src: &mut Vec<T>) {\n     let src_len = src.len();\n     let dst_len = dst.len();\n\n     // Ensure that `dst` has enough capacity to hold all of `src`.\n     dst.reserve(src_len);\n\n     unsafe {\n         // The call to add is always safe because `Vec` will never\n         // allocate more than `isize::MAX` bytes.\n         let dst_ptr = dst.as_mut_ptr().add(dst_len);\n         let src_ptr = src.as_ptr();\n\n         // Truncate `src` without dropping its contents.
