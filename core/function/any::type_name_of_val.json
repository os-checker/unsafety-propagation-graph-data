For example, amongst the strings\n that `type_name::<Option<String>>()` might return are `\"Option<String>\"` and\n `\"std::option::Option<std::string::String>\"`.\n\n The returned string must not be considered to be a unique identifier of a\n type as multiple types may map to the same type name. Similarly, there is no\n guarantee that all parts of a type will appear in the returned string. In\n addition, the output may change between versions of the compiler. For\n example, lifetime specifiers were omitted in some earlier versions.\n\n The current implementation uses the same infrastructure as compiler\n diagnostics and debuginfo, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```rust\n assert_eq!(\n     std::any::type_name::<Option<String>>(),\n     \"core::option::Option<alloc::string::String>\",\n );\n ```\n",
