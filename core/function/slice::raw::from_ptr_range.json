      "doc": " Calculates the distance between two pointers within the same allocation, *where it's known that\n `self` is equal to or greater than `origin`*. The returned value is in\n units of T: the distance in bytes is divided by `size_of::<T>()`.\n\n This computes the same value that [`offset_from`](#method.offset_from)\n would compute, but with the added precondition that the offset is\n guaranteed to be non-negative.  This method is equivalent to\n `usize::try_from(self.offset_from(origin)).unwrap_unchecked()`,\n but it provides slightly more information to the optimizer, which can\n sometimes allow it to optimize slightly better with some backends.\n\n This method can be thought of as recovering the `count` that was passed\n to [`add`](#method.add) (or, with the parameters in the other order,\n to [`sub`](#method.sub)).  The following are all equivalent, assuming\n that their safety preconditions are met:\n ```rust\n # unsafe fn blah(ptr: *const i32, origin: *const i32, count: usize) -> bool { unsafe {\n ptr.offset_from_unsigned(origin) == count\n # &&\n origin.add(count) == ptr\n # &&\n ptr.sub(count) == origin\n # } }\n ```\n\n # Safety\n\n - The distance between the pointers must be non-negative (`self >= origin`)\n\n - *All* the safety conditions of [`offset_from`](#method.offset_from)\n   apply to this method as well; see it for the full details.\n\n Importantly, despite the return type of this method being able to represent\n a larger offset, it's still *not permitted* to pass pointers which differ\n by more than `isize::MAX` *bytes*.  As such, the result of this method will\n always be less than or equal to `isize::MAX as usize`.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function panics if `T` is a Zero-Sized Type (\"ZST\").\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let a = [0; 5];\n let ptr1: *const i32 = &a[1];\n let ptr2: *const i32 = &a[3];\n unsafe {\n     assert_eq!(ptr2.offset_from_unsigned(ptr1), 2);\n     assert_eq!(ptr1.add(2), ptr2);\n     assert_eq!(ptr2.sub(2), ptr1);\n     assert_eq!(ptr2.offset_from_unsigned(ptr2), 0);\n }\n\n // This would be incorrect, as the pointers are not correctly ordered:\n // ptr1.offset_from_unsigned(ptr2)\n ```\n",

      "doc": " Forms a slice from a pointer and a length.\n\n The `len` argument is the number of **elements**, not the number of bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `data` must be non-null, [valid] for reads for `len * size_of::<T>()` many bytes,\n   and it must be properly aligned. This means in particular:\n\n     * The entire memory range of this slice must be contained within a single allocation!\n       Slices can never span across multiple allocations. See [below](#incorrect-usage)\n       for an example incorrectly not taking this into account.\n     * `data` must be non-null and aligned even for zero-length slices or slices of ZSTs. One\n       reason for this is that enum layout optimizations may rely on references\n       (including slices of any length) being aligned and non-null to distinguish\n       them from other data. You can obtain a pointer that is usable as `data`\n       for zero-length slices using [`NonNull::dangling()`].\n\n * `data` must point to `len` consecutive properly initialized values of type `T`.\n\n * The memory referenced by the returned slice must not be mutated for the duration\n   of lifetime `'a`, except inside an `UnsafeCell`.\n\n * The total size `len * size_of::<T>()` of the slice must be no larger than `isize::MAX`,\n   and adding that size to `data` must not \"wrap around\" the address space.\n   See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].\n\n # Caveat\n\n The lifetime for the returned slice is inferred from its usage. To\n prevent accidental misuse, it's suggested to tie the lifetime to whichever\n source lifetime is safe in the context, such as by providing a helper\n function taking the lifetime of a host value for the slice, or by explicit\n annotation.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::slice;\n\n // manifest a slice for a single element\n let x = 42;\n let ptr = &x as *const _;\n let slice = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, 1) };\n assert_eq!(slice[0], 42);\n ```\n\n ### Incorrect usage\n\n The following `join_slices` function is **unsound** ⚠️\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::slice;\n\n fn join_slices<'a, T>(fst: &'a [T], snd: &'a [T]) -> &'a [T] {\n     let fst_end = fst.as_ptr().wrapping_add(fst.len());\n     let snd_start = snd.as_ptr();\n     assert_eq!(fst_end, snd_start, \"Slices must be contiguous!\");\n     unsafe {\n         // The assertion above ensures `fst` and `snd` are contiguous, but they might\n         // still be contained within _different allocations_, in which case\n         // creating this slice is undefined behavior.\n         slice::from_raw_parts(fst.as_ptr(), fst.len() + snd.len())\n     }\n }\n\n fn main() {\n     // `a` and `b` are different allocations...\n     let a = 42;\n     let b = 27;\n     // ... which may nevertheless be laid out contiguously in memory: | a | b |\n     let _ = join_slices(slice::from_ref(&a), slice::from_ref(&b)); // UB\n }\n ```\n\n ### FFI: Handling null pointers\n\n In languages such as C++, pointers to empty collections are not guaranteed to be non-null.\n When accepting such pointers, they have to be checked for null-ness to avoid undefined\n behavior.\n\n ```\n use std::slice;\n\n /// Sum the elements of an FFI slice.\n ///\n /// # Safety\n ///\n /// If ptr is not NULL, it must be correctly aligned and\n /// point to `len` initialized items of type `f32`.\n unsafe extern \"C\" fn sum_slice(ptr: *const f32, len: usize) -> f32 {\n     let data = if ptr.is_null() {\n         // `len` is assumed to be 0.\n         &[]\n     } else {\n         // SAFETY: see function docstring.\n         unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len) }\n     };\n     data.into_iter().sum()\n }\n\n // This could be the result of C++'s std::vector::data():\n let ptr = std::ptr::null();\n // And this could be std::vector::size():\n let len = 0;\n assert_eq!(unsafe { sum_slice(ptr, len) }, 0.0);\n ```\n\n [valid]: ptr#safety\n [`NonNull::dangling()`]: ptr::NonNull::dangling\n",
