Consider using the [`unreachable!`] macro,\n which may prevent some optimizations but will safely panic in case it is\n actually reached at runtime. Benchmark your code to find out if using\n `unreachable_unchecked()` comes with a performance benefit.\n\n # Examples\n\n `unreachable_unchecked()` can be used in situations where the compiler\n can't prove invariants that were previously established. Such situations\n have a higher chance of occurring if those invariants are upheld by\n external code that the compiler can't analyze.\n ```\n fn prepare_inputs(divisors: &mut Vec<u32>) {\n     // Note to future-self when making changes: The invariant established\n     // here is NOT checked in `do_computation()`; if this changes, you HAVE\n     // to change `do_computation()`.\n     divisors.retain(|divisor| *divisor != 0)\n }\n\n /// # Safety\n /// All elements of `divisor` must be non-zero.\n unsafe fn do_computation(i: u32, divisors: &[u32]) -> u32 {\n     divisors.iter().fold(i, |acc, divisor| {\n         // Convince the compiler that a division by zero can't happen here\n         // and a check is not needed below.\n         if *divisor == 0 {\n             // Safety: `divisor` can't be zero because of `prepare_inputs`,\n             // but the compiler does not know about this. We *promise*\n             // that we always call `prepare_inputs`.\n             unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }\n         }\n         // The compiler would normally introduce a check here that prevents\n         // a division by zero. However, if `divisor` was zero, the branch\n         // above would reach what we explicitly marked as unreachable.\n         // The compiler concludes that `divisor` can't be zero at this point\n         // and removes the - now proven useless - check.\n         acc / divisor\n     })\n }\n\n let mut divisors = vec![2, 0, 4];\n prepare_inputs(&mut divisors);\n let result = unsafe {\n     // Safety: prepare_inputs() guarantees that divisors is non-zero\n     do_computation(100, &divisors)\n };\n assert_eq!(result, 12);\n\n ```\n\n While using `unreachable_unchecked()` is perfectly sound in the following\n example, as the compiler is able to prove that a division by zero is not\n possible, benchmarking reveals that `unreachable_unchecked()` provides\n no benefit over using [`unreachable!`], while the latter does not introduce\n the possibility of Undefined Behavior.\n\n ```\n fn div_1(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {\n     use std::hint::unreachable_unchecked;\n\n     // `b.saturating_add(1)` is always positive (not zero),\n     // hence `checked_div` will never return `None`.\n     // Therefore, the else branch is unreachable.\n     a.checked_div(b.saturating_add(1))\n         .unwrap_or_else(|| unsafe { unreachable_unchecked() })\n }\n\n assert_eq!(div_1(7, 0), 7);\n assert_eq!(div_1(9, 1), 4);\n assert_eq!(div_1(11, u32::MAX), 0);\n ```\n",
