However, as `map()` is\n lazy, it is best used when you're already working with other iterators.\n If you're doing some sort of looping for a side effect, it's considered\n more idiomatic to use [`for`] than `map()`.\n\n [`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.iter().map(|x| 2 * x);\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(4));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(6));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n If you're doing some sort of side effect, prefer [`for`] to `map()`:\n\n ```\n # #![allow(unused_must_use)]\n // don't do this:\n (0..5).map(|x| println!(\"{x}\"));\n\n // it won't even execute, as it is lazy.

      "doc": " Folds every element into an accumulator by applying an operation,\n returning the final result.\n\n `fold()` takes two arguments: an initial value, and a closure with two\n arguments: an 'accumulator', and an element. The closure returns the value that\n the accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n\n The initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\n call.\n\n After applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `fold()`\n returns the accumulator.\n\n This operation is sometimes called 'reduce' or 'inject'.\n\n Folding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want\n to produce a single value from it.\n\n Note: `fold()`, and similar methods that traverse the entire iterator,\n might not terminate for infinite iterators, even on traits for which a\n result is determinable in finite time.\n\n Note: [`reduce()`] can be used to use the first element as the initial\n value, if the accumulator type and item type is the same.\n\n Note: `fold()` combines elements in a *left-associative* fashion. For associative\n operators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative\n operators like `-` the order will affect the final result.\n For a *right-associative* version of `fold()`, see [`DoubleEndedIterator::rfold()`].\n\n # Note to Implementors\n\n Several of the other (forward) methods have default implementations in\n terms of this one, so try to implement this explicitly if it can\n do something better than the default `for` loop implementation.\n\n In particular, try to have this call `fold()` on the internal parts\n from which this iterator is composed.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n // the sum of all of the elements of the array\n let sum = a.iter().fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);\n\n assert_eq!(sum, 6);\n ```\n\n Let's walk through each step of the iteration here:\n\n | element | acc | x | result |\n |---------|-----|---|--------|\n |         | 0   |   |        |\n | 1       | 0   | 1 | 1      |\n | 2       | 1   | 2 | 3      |\n | 3       | 3   | 3 | 6      |\n\n And so, our final result, `6`.\n\n This example demonstrates the left-associative nature of `fold()`:\n it builds a string, starting with an initial value\n and continuing with each element from the front until the back:\n\n ```\n let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n let zero = \"0\".to_string();\n\n let result = numbers.iter().fold(zero, |acc, &x| {\n     format!(\"({acc} + {x})\")\n });\n\n assert_eq!(result, \"(((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)\");\n ```\n It's common for people who haven't used iterators a lot to\n use a `for` loop with a list of things to build up a result. Those\n can be turned into `fold()`s:\n\n [`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n ```\n let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n let mut result = 0;\n\n // for loop:\n for i in &numbers {\n     result = result + i;\n }\n\n // fold:\n let result2 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);\n\n // they're the same\n assert_eq!(result, result2);\n ```\n\n [`reduce()`]: Iterator::reduce\n",
