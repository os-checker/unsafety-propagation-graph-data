Similarly, subsequent\n instructions may begin execution before the read operation is\n performed.\n\n On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the\n high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are cleared.\n\n [Intel's documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#text=_rdtsc)\n",
