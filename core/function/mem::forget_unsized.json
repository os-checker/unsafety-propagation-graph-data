  "doc": " Like [`forget`], but also accepts unsized values.\n\n While Rust does not permit unsized locals since its removal in [#111942] it is\n still possible to call functions with unsized values from a function argument\n or place expression.\n\n ```rust\n #![feature(unsized_fn_params, forget_unsized)]\n #![allow(internal_features)]\n\n use std::mem::forget_unsized;\n\n pub fn in_place() {\n     forget_unsized(*Box::<str>::from(\"str\"));\n }\n\n pub fn param(x: str) {\n     forget_unsized(x);\n }\n ```\n\n This works because the compiler will alter these functions to pass the parameter\n by reference instead. This trick is necessary to support `Box<dyn FnOnce()>: FnOnce()`.\n See [#68304] and [#71170] for more information.\n\n [#111942]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/111942\n [#68304]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68304\n [#71170]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71170\n",
