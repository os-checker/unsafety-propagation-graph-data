However, this is\n not a problem as long as there does not also exist a `Pin<&T>` pointing\n to the inner `T` inside the `RefCell`, and `RefCell<T>` does not let you get a\n `Pin<&T>` pointer to its contents. See the discussion on [\"pinning projections\"]\n for further details.\n\n Note: `Pin` also implements `Deref` to the target, which can be used\n to access the inner value. However, `Deref` only provides a reference\n that lives for as long as the borrow of the `Pin`, not the lifetime of\n the reference contained in the `Pin`. This method allows turning the `Pin` into a reference\n with the same lifetime as the reference it wraps.\n\n [\"pinning projections\"]: self#projections-and-structural-pinning\n",
