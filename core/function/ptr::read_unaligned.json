      "doc": " Returns the size of a type in bytes.\n\n More specifically, this is the offset in bytes between successive elements\n in an array with that item type including alignment padding. Thus, for any\n type `T` and length `n`, `[T; n]` has a size of `n * size_of::<T>()`.\n\n In general, the size of a type is not stable across compilations, but\n specific types such as primitives are.\n\n The following table gives the size for primitives.\n\n Type | `size_of::<Type>()`\n ---- | ---------------\n () | 0\n bool | 1\n u8 | 1\n u16 | 2\n u32 | 4\n u64 | 8\n u128 | 16\n i8 | 1\n i16 | 2\n i32 | 4\n i64 | 8\n i128 | 16\n f32 | 4\n f64 | 8\n char | 4\n\n Furthermore, `usize` and `isize` have the same size.\n\n The types [`*const T`], `&T`, [`Box<T>`], [`Option<&T>`], and `Option<Box<T>>` all have\n the same size. If `T` is `Sized`, all of those types have the same size as `usize`.\n\n The mutability of a pointer does not change its size. As such, `&T` and `&mut T`\n have the same size. Likewise for `*const T` and `*mut T`.\n\n # Size of `#[repr(C)]` items\n\n The `C` representation for items has a defined layout. With this layout,\n the size of items is also stable as long as all fields have a stable size.\n\n ## Size of Structs\n\n For `struct`s, the size is determined by the following algorithm.\n\n For each field in the struct ordered by declaration order:\n\n 1. Add the size of the field.\n 2. Round up the current size to the nearest multiple of the next field's [alignment].\n\n Finally, round the size of the struct to the nearest multiple of its [alignment].\n The alignment of the struct is usually the largest alignment of all its\n fields; this can be changed with the use of `repr(align(N))`.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized structs are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n ## Size of Enums\n\n Enums that carry no data other than the discriminant have the same size as C enums\n on the platform they are compiled for.\n\n ## Size of Unions\n\n The size of a union is the size of its largest field.\n\n Unlike `C`, zero sized unions are not rounded up to one byte in size.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Some primitives\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<i32>());\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<f64>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<()>());\n\n // Some arrays\n assert_eq!(8, size_of::<[i32; 2]>());\n assert_eq!(12, size_of::<[i32; 3]>());\n assert_eq!(0, size_of::<[i32; 0]>());\n\n\n // Pointer size equality\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<*const i32>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Box<i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<&i32>(), size_of::<Option<&i32>>());\n assert_eq!(size_of::<Box<i32>>(), size_of::<Option<Box<i32>>>());\n ```\n\n Using `#[repr(C)]`.\n\n ```\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStruct {\n     first: u8,\n     second: u16,\n     third: u8\n }\n\n // The size of the first field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 1.\n // The alignment of the second field is 2, so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 2.\n // The size of the second field is 2, so add 2 to the size. Size is 4.\n // The alignment of the third field is 1, so add 0 to the size for padding. Size is 4.\n // The size of the third field is 1, so add 1 to the size. Size is 5.\n // Finally, the alignment of the struct is 2 (because the largest alignment amongst its\n // fields is 2), so add 1 to the size for padding. Size is 6.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<FieldStruct>());\n\n #[repr(C)]\n struct TupleStruct(u8, u16, u8);\n\n // Tuple structs follow the same rules.\n assert_eq!(6, size_of::<TupleStruct>());\n\n // Note that reordering the fields can lower the size. We can remove both padding bytes\n // by putting `third` before `second`.\n #[repr(C)]\n struct FieldStructOptimized {\n     first: u8,\n     third: u8,\n     second: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(4, size_of::<FieldStructOptimized>());\n\n // Union size is the size of the largest field.\n #[repr(C)]\n union ExampleUnion {\n     smaller: u8,\n     larger: u16\n }\n\n assert_eq!(2, size_of::<ExampleUnion>());\n ```\n\n [alignment]: align_of\n [`*const T`]: primitive@pointer\n [`Box<T>`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html\n [`Option<&T>`]: crate::option::Option\n\n",
