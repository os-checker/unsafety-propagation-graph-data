For instance, the\n following is an **incorrect** use of this function:\n\n ```rust,no_run\n unsafe {\n     let mut value: u8 = 0;\n     let ptr: *mut bool = &mut value as *mut u8 as *mut bool;\n     let _bool = ptr.read(); // This is fine, `ptr` points to a valid `bool`.\n     ptr.write_bytes(42u8, 1); // This function itself does not cause UB...\n     let _bool = ptr.read(); // ...but it makes this operation UB! ⚠️\n }\n ```\n\n [valid]: crate::ptr#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let mut vec = vec![0u32; 4];\n unsafe {\n     let vec_ptr = vec.as_mut_ptr();\n     ptr::write_bytes(vec_ptr, 0xfe, 2);\n }\n assert_eq!(vec, [0xfefefefe, 0xfefefefe, 0, 0]);\n ```\n",
