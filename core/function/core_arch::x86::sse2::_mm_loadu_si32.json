This leaves the\n memory in `src` unchanged.\n\n Unlike [`read`], `read_unaligned` works with unaligned pointers.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `src` must be [valid] for reads.\n\n * `src` must point to a properly initialized value of type `T`.\n\n Like [`read`], `read_unaligned` creates a bitwise copy of `T`, regardless of\n whether `T` is [`Copy`]. If `T` is not [`Copy`], using both the returned\n value and the value at `*src` can [violate memory safety][read-ownership].\n\n [read-ownership]: read#ownership-of-the-returned-value\n [valid]: self#safety\n\n ## On `packed` structs\n\n Attempting to create a raw pointer to an `unaligned` struct field with\n an expression such as `&packed.unaligned as *const FieldType` creates an\n intermediate unaligned reference before converting that to a raw pointer.\n That this reference is temporary and immediately cast is inconsequential\n as the compiler always expects references to be properly aligned.\n As a result, using `&packed.unaligned as *const FieldType` causes immediate\n *undefined behavior* in your program.\n\n Instead you must use the `&raw const` syntax to create the pointer.\n You may use that constructed pointer together with this function.\n\n An example of what not to do and how this relates to `read_unaligned` is:\n\n ```\n #[repr(packed, C)]\n struct Packed {\n     _padding: u8,\n     unaligned: u32,\n }\n\n let packed = Packed {\n     _padding: 0x00,\n     unaligned: 0x01020304,\n };\n\n // Take the address of a 32-bit integer which is not aligned.\n // In contrast to `&packed.unaligned as *const _`, this has no undefined behavior.\n let unaligned = &raw const packed.unaligned;\n\n let v = unsafe { std::ptr::read_unaligned(unaligned) };\n assert_eq!(v, 0x01020304);\n ```\n\n Accessing unaligned fields directly with e.g. `packed.unaligned` is safe however.\n\n # Examples\n\n Read a `usize` value from a byte buffer:\n\n ```\n fn read_usize(x: &[u8]) -> usize {\n     assert!(x.len() >= size_of::<usize>());\n\n     let ptr = x.as_ptr() as *const usize;\n\n     unsafe { ptr.read_unaligned() }\n }\n ```\n",
