  "doc": " Creates a new `RawWakerVTable` from the provided `clone`, `wake`,\n `wake_by_ref`, and `drop` functions.\n\n If the [`RawWaker`] will be used to construct a [`Waker`] then\n these functions must all be thread-safe (even though [`RawWaker`] is\n <code>\\![Send] + \\![Sync]</code>). This is because [`Waker`] is <code>[Send] + [Sync]</code>,\n and it may be moved to arbitrary threads or invoked by `&` reference. For example,\n this means that if the `clone` and `drop` functions manage a reference count,\n they must do so atomically.\n\n However, if the [`RawWaker`] will be used to construct a [`LocalWaker`] instead, then\n these functions don't need to be thread safe. This means that <code>\\![Send] + \\![Sync]</code>\n data can be stored in the data pointer, and reference counting does not need any atomic\n synchronization. This is because [`LocalWaker`] is not thread safe itself, so it cannot\n be sent across threads.\n # `clone`\n\n This function will be called when the [`RawWaker`] gets cloned, e.g. when\n the [`Waker`]/[`LocalWaker`] in which the [`RawWaker`] is stored gets cloned.\n\n The implementation of this function must retain all resources that are\n required for this additional instance of a [`RawWaker`] and associated\n task. Calling `wake` on the resulting [`RawWaker`] should result in a wakeup\n of the same task that would have been awoken by the original [`RawWaker`].\n\n # `wake`\n\n This function will be called when `wake` is called on the [`Waker`].\n It must wake up the task associated with this [`RawWaker`].\n\n The implementation of this function must make sure to release any\n resources that are associated with this instance of a [`RawWaker`] and\n associated task.\n\n # `wake_by_ref`\n\n This function will be called when `wake_by_ref` is called on the [`Waker`].\n It must wake up the task associated with this [`RawWaker`].\n\n This function is similar to `wake`, but must not consume the provided data\n pointer.\n\n # `drop`\n\n This function will be called when a [`Waker`]/[`LocalWaker`] gets\n dropped.\n\n The implementation of this function must make sure to release any\n resources that are associated with this instance of a [`RawWaker`] and\n associated task.\n",
