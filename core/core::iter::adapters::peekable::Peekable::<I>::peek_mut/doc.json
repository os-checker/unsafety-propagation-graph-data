  "doc": " Returns a mutable reference to the next() value without advancing the iterator.\n\n Like [`next`], if there is a value, it is wrapped in a `Some(T)`.\n But if the iteration is over, `None` is returned.\n\n Because `peek_mut()` returns a reference, and many iterators iterate over\n references, there can be a possibly confusing situation where the\n return value is a double reference. You can see this effect in the examples\n below.\n\n [`next`]: Iterator::next\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let mut iter = [1, 2, 3].iter().peekable();\n\n // Like with `peek()`, we can see into the future without advancing the iterator.\n assert_eq!(iter.peek_mut(), Some(&mut &1));\n assert_eq!(iter.peek_mut(), Some(&mut &1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&1));\n\n // Peek into the iterator and set the value behind the mutable reference.\n if let Some(p) = iter.peek_mut() {\n     assert_eq!(*p, &2);\n     *p = &5;\n }\n\n // The value we put in reappears as the iterator continues.\n assert_eq!(iter.collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec![&5, &3]);\n ```\n"
