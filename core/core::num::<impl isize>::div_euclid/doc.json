  "doc": " Calculates the quotient of Euclidean division of `self` by `rhs`.\n\n This computes the integer `q` such that `self = q * rhs + r`, with\n `r = self.rem_euclid(rhs)` and `0 <= r < abs(rhs)`.\n\n In other words, the result is `self / rhs` rounded to the integer `q`\n such that `self >= q * rhs`.\n If `self > 0`, this is equal to rounding towards zero (the default in Rust);\n if `self < 0`, this is equal to rounding away from zero (towards +/- infinity).\n If `rhs > 0`, this is equal to rounding towards -infinity;\n if `rhs < 0`, this is equal to rounding towards +infinity.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if `rhs` is zero or if `self` is `Self::MIN`\n and `rhs` is -1. This behavior is not affected by the `overflow-checks` flag.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let b = 4;\n\n assert_eq!(a.div_euclid(b), 1); // 7 >= 4 * 1\n assert_eq!(a.div_euclid(-b), -1); // 7 >= -4 * -1\n assert_eq!((-a).div_euclid(b), -2); // -7 >= 4 * -2\n assert_eq!((-a).div_euclid(-b), 2); // -7 >= -4 * 2\n ```\n"
