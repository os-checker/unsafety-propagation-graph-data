  "doc": " Minimum with the current value.\n\n Finds the minimum of the current value and the argument `val`, and\n sets the new value to the result.\n\n Returns the previous value.\n\n `fetch_min` takes an [`Ordering`] argument which describes the memory ordering\n of this operation. All ordering modes are possible. Note that using\n [`Acquire`] makes the store part of this operation [`Relaxed`], and\n using [`Release`] makes the load part [`Relaxed`].\n\n **Note**: This method is only available on platforms that support atomic operations on\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_min(42, Ordering::Relaxed), 23);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::Relaxed), 23);\n assert_eq!(foo.fetch_min(22, Ordering::Relaxed), 23);\n assert_eq!(foo.load(Ordering::Relaxed), 22);\n ```\n\n If you want to obtain the minimum value in one step, you can use the following:\n\n ```\n\n let bar = 12;\n let min_foo = foo.fetch_min(bar, Ordering::SeqCst).min(bar);\n assert_eq!(min_foo, 12);\n ```\n"
