  "doc": " Tries to reserve capacity for at least `additional` more bytes to be\n inserted in the given `Wtf8Buf`. The `Wtf8Buf` may reserve more space to\n avoid frequent reallocations. After calling `try_reserve`, capacity will\n be greater than or equal to `self.len() + additional`. Does nothing if\n capacity is already sufficient. This method preserves the contents even\n if an error occurs.\n\n # Errors\n\n If the capacity overflows, or the allocator reports a failure, then an error\n is returned.\n"
