  "doc": " Converts a slice of bytes to a string, including invalid characters.\n\n Strings are made of bytes ([`u8`]), and a slice of bytes\n ([`&[u8]`][byteslice]) is made of bytes, so this function converts\n between the two. Not all byte slices are valid strings, however: strings\n are required to be valid UTF-8. During this conversion,\n `from_utf8_lossy()` will replace any invalid UTF-8 sequences with\n [`U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`][U+FFFD], which looks like this: �\n\n [byteslice]: prim@slice\n [U+FFFD]: core::char::REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER\n\n If you are sure that the byte slice is valid UTF-8, and you don't want\n to incur the overhead of the conversion, there is an unsafe version\n of this function, [`from_utf8_unchecked`], which has the same behavior\n but skips the checks.\n\n [`from_utf8_unchecked`]: String::from_utf8_unchecked\n\n This function returns a [`Cow<'a, str>`]. If our byte slice is invalid\n UTF-8, then we need to insert the replacement characters, which will\n change the size of the string, and hence, require a `String`. But if\n it's already valid UTF-8, we don't need a new allocation. This return\n type allows us to handle both cases.\n\n [`Cow<'a, str>`]: crate::borrow::Cow \"borrow::Cow\"\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n // some bytes, in a vector\n let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];\n\n let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8_lossy(&sparkle_heart);\n\n assert_eq!(\"💖\", sparkle_heart);\n ```\n\n Incorrect bytes:\n\n ```\n // some invalid bytes\n let input = b\"Hello \\xF0\\x90\\x80World\";\n let output = String::from_utf8_lossy(input);\n\n assert_eq!(\"Hello �World\", output);\n ```\n"
