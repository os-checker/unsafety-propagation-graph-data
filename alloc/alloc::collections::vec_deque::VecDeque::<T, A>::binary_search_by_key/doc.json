  "doc": " Binary searches this `VecDeque` with a key extraction function.\n\n Assumes that the deque is sorted by the key, for instance with\n [`make_contiguous().sort_by_key()`] using the same key extraction function.\n If the deque is not sorted by the key, the returned result is\n unspecified and meaningless.\n\n If the value is found then [`Result::Ok`] is returned, containing the\n index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any\n one of the matches could be returned. If the value is not found then\n [`Result::Err`] is returned, containing the index where a matching\n element could be inserted while maintaining sorted order.\n\n See also [`binary_search`], [`binary_search_by`], and [`partition_point`].\n\n [`make_contiguous().sort_by_key()`]: VecDeque::make_contiguous\n [`binary_search`]: VecDeque::binary_search\n [`binary_search_by`]: VecDeque::binary_search_by\n [`partition_point`]: VecDeque::partition_point\n\n # Examples\n\n Looks up a series of four elements in a slice of pairs sorted by\n their second elements. The first is found, with a uniquely\n determined position; the second and third are not found; the\n fourth could match any position in `[1, 4]`.\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let deque: VecDeque<_> = [(0, 0), (2, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1),\n          (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5), (5, 8), (3, 13),\n          (1, 21), (2, 34), (4, 55)].into();\n\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search_by_key(&13, |&(a, b)| b),  Ok(9));\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search_by_key(&4, |&(a, b)| b),   Err(7));\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search_by_key(&100, |&(a, b)| b), Err(13));\n let r = deque.binary_search_by_key(&1, |&(a, b)| b);\n assert!(matches!(r, Ok(1..=4)));\n ```\n"
