  "doc": " Chooses a balancing context involving the node as a child, thus between\n the KV immediately to the left or to the right in the parent node.\n Returns an `Err` if there is no parent.\n Panics if the parent is empty.\n\n Prefers the left side, to be optimal if the given node is somehow\n underfull, meaning here only that it has fewer elements than its left\n sibling and than its right sibling, if they exist. In that case,\n merging with the left sibling is faster, since we only need to move\n the node's N elements, instead of shifting them to the right and moving\n more than N elements in front. Stealing from the left sibling is also\n typically faster, since we only need to shift the node's N elements to\n the right, instead of shifting at least N of the sibling's elements to\n the left.\n"
