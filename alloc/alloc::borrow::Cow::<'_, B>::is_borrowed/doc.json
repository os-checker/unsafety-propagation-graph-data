  "doc": " Returns true if the data is borrowed, i.e. if `to_mut` would require additional work.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have to call\n it as `Cow::is_borrowed(&c)` instead of `c.is_borrowed()`. This is so\n that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(cow_is_borrowed)]\n use std::borrow::Cow;\n\n let cow = Cow::Borrowed(\"moo\");\n assert!(Cow::is_borrowed(&cow));\n\n let bull: Cow<'_, str> = Cow::Owned(\"...moo?\".to_string());\n assert!(!Cow::is_borrowed(&bull));\n ```\n"
