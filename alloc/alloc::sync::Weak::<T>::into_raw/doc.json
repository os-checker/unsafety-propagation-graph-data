  "doc": " Consumes the `Weak<T>` and turns it into a raw pointer.\n\n This converts the weak pointer into a raw pointer, while still preserving the ownership of\n one weak reference (the weak count is not modified by this operation). It can be turned\n back into the `Weak<T>` with [`from_raw`].\n\n The same restrictions of accessing the target of the pointer as with\n [`as_ptr`] apply.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::{Arc, Weak};\n\n let strong = Arc::new(\"hello\".to_owned());\n let weak = Arc::downgrade(&strong);\n let raw = weak.into_raw();\n\n assert_eq!(1, Arc::weak_count(&strong));\n assert_eq!(\"hello\", unsafe { &*raw });\n\n drop(unsafe { Weak::from_raw(raw) });\n assert_eq!(0, Arc::weak_count(&strong));\n ```\n\n [`from_raw`]: Weak::from_raw\n [`as_ptr`]: Weak::as_ptr\n"
