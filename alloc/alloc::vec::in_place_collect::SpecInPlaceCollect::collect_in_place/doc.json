  "doc": " Collects an iterator (`self`) into the destination buffer (`dst`) and returns the number of items\n collected. `end` is the last writable element of the allocation and used for bounds checks.\n\n This method is specialized and one of its implementations makes use of\n `Iterator::__iterator_get_unchecked` calls with a `TrustedRandomAccessNoCoerce` bound\n on `I` which means the caller of this method must take the safety conditions\n of that trait into consideration.\n"
