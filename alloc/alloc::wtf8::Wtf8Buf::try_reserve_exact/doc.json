After calling\n `try_reserve_exact`, capacity will be greater than or equal to\n `self.len() + additional` if it returns `Ok(())`.\n Does nothing if the capacity is already sufficient.\n\n Note that the allocator may give the `Wtf8Buf` more space than it\n requests. Therefore, capacity can not be relied upon to be precisely\n minimal. Prefer [`try_reserve`] if future insertions are expected.\n\n [`try_reserve`]: Wtf8Buf::try_reserve\n\n # Errors\n\n If the capacity overflows, or the allocator reports a failure, then an error\n is returned.\n"
