  "doc": " Disposes of a value.\n\n This effectively does nothing for types which implement `Copy`, e.g.\n integers. Such values are copied and _then_ moved into the function, so the\n value persists after this function call.\n\n This function is not magic; it is literally defined as\n\n ```\n pub fn drop<T>(_x: T) {}\n ```\n\n Because `_x` is moved into the function, it is automatically [dropped][drop] before\n the function returns.\n\n [drop]: Drop\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let v = vec![1, 2, 3];\n\n drop(v); // explicitly drop the vector\n ```\n\n Since [`RefCell`] enforces the borrow rules at runtime, `drop` can\n release a [`RefCell`] borrow:\n\n ```\n use std::cell::RefCell;\n\n let x = RefCell::new(1);\n\n let mut mutable_borrow = x.borrow_mut();\n *mutable_borrow = 1;\n\n drop(mutable_borrow); // relinquish the mutable borrow on this slot\n\n let borrow = x.borrow();\n println!(\"{}\", *borrow);\n ```\n\n Integers and other types implementing [`Copy`] are unaffected by `drop`.\n\n ```\n # #![allow(dropping_copy_types)]\n #[derive(Copy, Clone)]\n struct Foo(u8);\n\n let x = 1;\n let y = Foo(2);\n drop(x); // a copy of `x` is moved and dropped\n drop(y); // a copy of `y` is moved and dropped\n\n println!(\"x: {}, y: {}\", x, y.0); // still available\n ```\n\n [`RefCell`]: crate::cell::RefCell\n"
