  "doc": " Reserves the minimum capacity for at least `additional` bytes more than\n the current length. Unlike [`reserve`], this will not\n deliberately over-allocate to speculatively avoid frequent allocations.\n After calling `reserve_exact`, capacity will be greater than or equal to\n `self.len() + additional`. Does nothing if the capacity is already\n sufficient.\n\n [`reserve`]: String::reserve\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` _bytes_.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let mut s = String::new();\n\n s.reserve_exact(10);\n\n assert!(s.capacity() >= 10);\n ```\n\n This might not actually increase the capacity:\n\n ```\n let mut s = String::with_capacity(10);\n s.push('a');\n s.push('b');\n\n // s now has a length of 2 and a capacity of at least 10\n let capacity = s.capacity();\n assert_eq!(2, s.len());\n assert!(capacity >= 10);\n\n // Since we already have at least an extra 8 capacity, calling this...\n s.reserve_exact(8);\n\n // ... doesn't actually increase.\n assert_eq!(capacity, s.capacity());\n ```\n"
