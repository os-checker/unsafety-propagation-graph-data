  "doc": " Reconstitutes a `RawVec` from a pointer, capacity, and allocator.\n\n # Safety\n\n The `ptr` must be allocated (via the given allocator `alloc`), and with the given\n `capacity`.\n The `capacity` cannot exceed `isize::MAX` for sized types. (only a concern on 32-bit\n systems). For ZSTs capacity is ignored.\n If the `ptr` and `capacity` come from a `RawVec` created via `alloc`, then this is\n guaranteed.\n"
