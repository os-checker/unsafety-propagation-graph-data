If it doesn't already have enough capacity, will\n reallocate enough space plus comfortable slack space to get amortized\n *O*(1) behavior. Will limit this behavior if it would needlessly cause\n itself to panic.\n\n If `len` exceeds `self.capacity()`, this may fail to actually allocate\n the requested space. This is not really unsafe, but the unsafe\n code *you* write that relies on the behavior of this function may break.\n\n This is ideal for implementing a bulk-push operation like `extend`.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` _bytes_.\n\n # Aborts\n\n Aborts on OOM.\n"
