  "doc": " Clears the binary heap, returning an iterator over the removed elements\n in arbitrary order. If the iterator is dropped before being fully\n consumed, it drops the remaining elements in arbitrary order.\n\n The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the heap to optimize\n its implementation.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::from([1, 3]);\n\n assert!(!heap.is_empty());\n\n for x in heap.drain() {\n     println!(\"{x}\");\n }\n\n assert!(heap.is_empty());\n ```\n"
