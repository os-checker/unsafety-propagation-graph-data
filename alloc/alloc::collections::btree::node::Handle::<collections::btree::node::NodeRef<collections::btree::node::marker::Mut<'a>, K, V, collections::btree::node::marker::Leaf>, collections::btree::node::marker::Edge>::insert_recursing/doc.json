This method splits the node if there isn't enough room, and tries to\n insert the split off portion into the parent node recursively, until the root is reached.\n\n If the returned result is some `SplitResult`, the `left` field will be the root node.\n The returned pointer points to the inserted value, which in the case of `SplitResult`\n is in the `left` or `right` tree.\n"
