  "doc": " Converts the cursor into a [`CursorMutKey`], which allows mutating\n elements in the tree.\n\n # Safety\n\n Since this cursor allows mutating elements, you must ensure that the\n `BTreeSet` invariants are maintained. Specifically:\n\n * The newly inserted element must be unique in the tree.\n * All elements in the tree must remain in sorted order.\n"
