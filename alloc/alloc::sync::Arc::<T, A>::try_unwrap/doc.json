  "doc": " Returns the inner value, if the `Arc` has exactly one strong reference.\n\n Otherwise, an [`Err`] is returned with the same `Arc` that was\n passed in.\n\n This will succeed even if there are outstanding weak references.\n\n It is strongly recommended to use [`Arc::into_inner`] instead if you don't\n keep the `Arc` in the [`Err`] case.\n Immediately dropping the [`Err`]-value, as the expression\n `Arc::try_unwrap(this).ok()` does, can cause the strong count to\n drop to zero and the inner value of the `Arc` to be dropped.\n For instance, if two threads execute such an expression in parallel,\n there is a race condition without the possibility of unsafety:\n The threads could first both check whether they own the last instance\n in `Arc::try_unwrap`, determine that they both do not, and then both\n discard and drop their instance in the call to [`ok`][`Result::ok`].\n In this scenario, the value inside the `Arc` is safely destroyed\n by exactly one of the threads, but neither thread will ever be able\n to use the value.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::Arc;\n\n let x = Arc::new(3);\n assert_eq!(Arc::try_unwrap(x), Ok(3));\n\n let x = Arc::new(4);\n let _y = Arc::clone(&x);\n assert_eq!(*Arc::try_unwrap(x).unwrap_err(), 4);\n ```\n"
