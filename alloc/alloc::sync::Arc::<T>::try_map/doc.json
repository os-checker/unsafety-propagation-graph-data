  "doc": " Attempts to map the value in an `Arc`, reusing the allocation if possible.\n\n `f` is called on a reference to the value in the `Arc`, and if the operation succeeds, the\n result is returned, also in an `Arc`.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `Arc::try_map(a, f)` instead of `a.try_map(f)`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(smart_pointer_try_map)]\n\n use std::sync::Arc;\n\n let b = Arc::new(7);\n let new = Arc::try_map(b, |&i| u32::try_from(i)).unwrap();\n assert_eq!(*new, 7);\n ```\n"
