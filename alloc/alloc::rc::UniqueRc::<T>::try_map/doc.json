  "doc": " Attempts to map the value in a `UniqueRc`, reusing the allocation if possible.\n\n `f` is called on a reference to the value in the `UniqueRc`, and if the operation succeeds,\n the result is returned, also in a `UniqueRc`.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `UniqueRc::try_map(u, f)` instead of `u.try_map(f)`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(smart_pointer_try_map)]\n #![feature(unique_rc_arc)]\n\n use std::rc::UniqueRc;\n\n let b = UniqueRc::new(7);\n let new = UniqueRc::try_map(b, u32::try_from).unwrap();\n assert_eq!(*new, 7);\n ```\n"
