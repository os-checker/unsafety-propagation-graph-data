  "doc": " Tries to reserve capacity for at least `additional` bytes more than the\n current length. The allocator may reserve more space to speculatively\n avoid frequent allocations. After calling `try_reserve`, capacity will be\n greater than or equal to `self.len() + additional` if it returns\n `Ok(())`. Does nothing if capacity is already sufficient. This method\n preserves the contents even if an error occurs.\n\n # Errors\n\n If the capacity overflows, or the allocator reports a failure, then an error\n is returned.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::TryReserveError;\n\n fn process_data(data: &str) -> Result<String, TryReserveError> {\n     let mut output = String::new();\n\n     // Pre-reserve the memory, exiting if we can't\n     output.try_reserve(data.len())?;\n\n     // Now we know this can't OOM in the middle of our complex work\n     output.push_str(data);\n\n     Ok(output)\n }\n # process_data(\"rust\").expect(\"why is the test harness OOMing on 4 bytes?\");\n ```\n"
