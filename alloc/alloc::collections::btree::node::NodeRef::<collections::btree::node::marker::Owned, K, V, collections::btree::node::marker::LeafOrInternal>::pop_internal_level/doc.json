  "doc": " Removes the internal root node, using its first child as the new root node.\n As it is intended only to be called when the root node has only one child,\n no cleanup is done on any of the keys, values and other children.\n This decreases the height by 1 and is the opposite of `push_internal_level`.\n\n Does not invalidate any handles or references pointing into the subtree\n rooted at the first child of `self`.\n\n Panics if there is no internal level, i.e., if the root node is a leaf.\n"
