  "doc": " Creates an iterator with the provided closure\n `F: FnMut() -> Option<T>` as its [`next`](Iterator::next) method.\n\n The iterator will yield the `T`s returned from the closure.\n\n This allows creating a custom iterator with any behavior\n without using the more verbose syntax of creating a dedicated type\n and implementing the [`Iterator`] trait for it.\n\n Note that the `FromFn` iterator doesn’t make assumptions about the behavior of the closure,\n and therefore conservatively does not implement [`FusedIterator`],\n or override [`Iterator::size_hint()`] from its default `(0, None)`.\n\n The closure can use captures and its environment to track state across iterations. Depending on\n how the iterator is used, this may require specifying the [`move`] keyword on the closure.\n\n [`move`]: ../../std/keyword.move.html\n [`FusedIterator`]: crate::iter::FusedIterator\n\n # Examples\n\n Let’s re-implement the counter iterator from [module-level documentation]:\n\n [module-level documentation]: crate::iter\n\n ```\n let mut count = 0;\n let counter = std::iter::from_fn(move || {\n     // Increment our count. This is why we started at zero.\n     count += 1;\n\n     // Check to see if we've finished counting or not.\n     if count < 6 {\n         Some(count)\n     } else {\n         None\n     }\n });\n assert_eq!(counter.collect::<Vec<_>>(), &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n ```\n"
