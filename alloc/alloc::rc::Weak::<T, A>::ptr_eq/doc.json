  "doc": " Returns `true` if the two `Weak`s point to the same allocation similar to [`ptr::eq`], or if\n both don't point to any allocation (because they were created with `Weak::new()`). However,\n this function ignores the metadata of  `dyn Trait` pointers.\n\n # Notes\n\n Since this compares pointers it means that `Weak::new()` will equal each\n other, even though they don't point to any allocation.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::rc::Rc;\n\n let first_rc = Rc::new(5);\n let first = Rc::downgrade(&first_rc);\n let second = Rc::downgrade(&first_rc);\n\n assert!(first.ptr_eq(&second));\n\n let third_rc = Rc::new(5);\n let third = Rc::downgrade(&third_rc);\n\n assert!(!first.ptr_eq(&third));\n ```\n\n Comparing `Weak::new`.\n\n ```\n use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};\n\n let first = Weak::new();\n let second = Weak::new();\n assert!(first.ptr_eq(&second));\n\n let third_rc = Rc::new(());\n let third = Rc::downgrade(&third_rc);\n assert!(!first.ptr_eq(&third));\n ```\n"
