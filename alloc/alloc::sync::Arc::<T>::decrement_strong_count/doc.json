  "doc": " Decrements the strong reference count on the `Arc<T>` associated with the\n provided pointer by one.\n\n # Safety\n\n The pointer must have been obtained through `Arc::into_raw` and must satisfy the\n same layout requirements specified in [`Arc::from_raw_in`][from_raw_in].\n The associated `Arc` instance must be valid (i.e. the strong count must be at\n least 1) when invoking this method, and `ptr` must point to a block of memory\n allocated by the global allocator. This method can be used to release the final\n `Arc` and backing storage, but **should not** be called after the final `Arc` has been\n released.\n\n [from_raw_in]: Arc::from_raw_in\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::Arc;\n\n let five = Arc::new(5);\n\n unsafe {\n     let ptr = Arc::into_raw(five);\n     Arc::increment_strong_count(ptr);\n\n     // Those assertions are deterministic because we haven't shared\n     // the `Arc` between threads.\n     let five = Arc::from_raw(ptr);\n     assert_eq!(2, Arc::strong_count(&five));\n     Arc::decrement_strong_count(ptr);\n     assert_eq!(1, Arc::strong_count(&five));\n }\n ```\n"
