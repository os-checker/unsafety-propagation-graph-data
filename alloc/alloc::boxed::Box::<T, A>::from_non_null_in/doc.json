  "doc": " Constructs a box from a `NonNull` pointer in the given allocator.\n\n After calling this function, the `NonNull` pointer is owned by\n the resulting `Box`. Specifically, the `Box` destructor will call\n the destructor of `T` and free the allocated memory. For this\n to be safe, the memory must have been allocated in accordance\n with the [memory layout] used by `Box` .\n\n # Safety\n\n This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to\n memory problems. For example, a double-free may occur if the\n function is called twice on the same raw pointer.\n\n The non-null pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by `alloc`.\n\n # Examples\n\n Recreate a `Box` which was previously converted to a `NonNull` pointer\n using [`Box::into_non_null_with_allocator`]:\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api, box_vec_non_null)]\n\n use std::alloc::System;\n\n let x = Box::new_in(5, System);\n let (non_null, alloc) = Box::into_non_null_with_allocator(x);\n let x = unsafe { Box::from_non_null_in(non_null, alloc) };\n ```\n Manually create a `Box` from scratch by using the system allocator:\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api, box_vec_non_null, slice_ptr_get)]\n\n use std::alloc::{Allocator, Layout, System};\n\n unsafe {\n     let non_null = System.allocate(Layout::new::<i32>())?.cast::<i32>();\n     // In general .write is required to avoid attempting to destruct\n     // the (uninitialized) previous contents of `non_null`.\n     non_null.write(5);\n     let x = Box::from_non_null_in(non_null, System);\n }\n # Ok::<(), std::alloc::AllocError>(())\n ```\n\n [memory layout]: self#memory-layout\n"
