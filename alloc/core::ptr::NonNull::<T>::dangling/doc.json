  "doc": " Creates a new `NonNull` that is dangling, but well-aligned.\n\n This is useful for initializing types which lazily allocate, like\n `Vec::new` does.\n\n Note that the address of the returned pointer may potentially\n be that of a valid pointer, which means this must not be used\n as a \"not yet initialized\" sentinel value.\n Types that lazily allocate must track initialization by some other means.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::ptr::NonNull;\n\n let ptr = NonNull::<u32>::dangling();\n // Important: don't try to access the value of `ptr` without\n // initializing it first! The pointer is not null but isn't valid either!\n ```\n"
