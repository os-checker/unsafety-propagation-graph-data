  "doc": " Consumes the iterator, counting the number of iterations and returning it.\n\n This method will call [`next`] repeatedly until [`None`] is encountered,\n returning the number of times it saw [`Some`]. Note that [`next`] has to be\n called at least once even if the iterator does not have any elements.\n\n [`next`]: Iterator::next\n\n # Overflow Behavior\n\n The method does no guarding against overflows, so counting elements of\n an iterator with more than [`usize::MAX`] elements either produces the\n wrong result or panics. If overflow checks are enabled, a panic is\n guaranteed.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function might panic if the iterator has more than [`usize::MAX`]\n elements.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n assert_eq!(a.iter().count(), 3);\n\n let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n assert_eq!(a.iter().count(), 5);\n ```\n"
