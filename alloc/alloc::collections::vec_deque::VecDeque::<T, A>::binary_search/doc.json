If there are multiple matches, then any\n one of the matches could be returned. If the value is not found then\n [`Result::Err`] is returned, containing the index where a matching\n element could be inserted while maintaining sorted order.\n\n See also [`binary_search_by`], [`binary_search_by_key`], and [`partition_point`].\n\n [`binary_search_by`]: VecDeque::binary_search_by\n [`binary_search_by_key`]: VecDeque::binary_search_by_key\n [`partition_point`]: VecDeque::partition_point\n\n # Examples\n\n Looks up a series of four elements. The first is found, with a\n uniquely determined position; the second and third are not\n found; the fourth could match any position in `[1, 4]`.\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let deque: VecDeque<_> = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55].into();\n\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search(&13),  Ok(9));\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search(&4),   Err(7));\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search(&100), Err(13));\n let r = deque.binary_search(&1);\n assert!(matches!(r, Ok(1..=4)));\n ```\n\n If you want to insert an item to a sorted deque, while maintaining\n sort order, consider using [`partition_point`]:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let mut deque: VecDeque<_> = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55].into();\n let num = 42;\n let idx = deque.partition_point(|&x| x <= num);\n // If `num` is unique, `s.partition_point(|&x| x < num)` (with `<`) is equivalent to\n // `s.binary_search(&num).unwrap_or_else(|x| x)`, but using `<=` may allow `insert`\n // to shift less elements.\n deque.insert(idx, num);\n assert_eq!(deque, &[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 42, 55]);\n ```\n"
