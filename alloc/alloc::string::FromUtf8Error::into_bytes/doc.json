  "doc": " Returns the bytes that were attempted to convert to a `String`.\n\n This method is carefully constructed to avoid allocation. It will\n consume the error, moving out the bytes, so that a copy of the bytes\n does not need to be made.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // some invalid bytes, in a vector\n let bytes = vec![0, 159];\n\n let value = String::from_utf8(bytes);\n\n assert_eq!(vec![0, 159], value.unwrap_err().into_bytes());\n ```\n"
