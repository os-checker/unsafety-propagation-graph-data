  "doc": " Reserves the minimum capacity for at least `additional` elements more than\n the current length. Unlike [`reserve`], this will not\n deliberately over-allocate to speculatively avoid frequent allocations.\n After calling `reserve_exact`, capacity will be greater than or equal to\n `self.len() + additional`. Does nothing if the capacity is already\n sufficient.\n\n [`reserve`]: BinaryHeap::reserve\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity overflows [`usize`].\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();\n heap.reserve_exact(100);\n assert!(heap.capacity() >= 100);\n heap.push(4);\n ```\n\n [`reserve`]: BinaryHeap::reserve\n"
