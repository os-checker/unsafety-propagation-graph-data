  "doc": " Returns the exact remaining length of the iterator.\n\n The implementation ensures that the iterator will return exactly `len()`\n more times a [`Some(T)`] value, before returning [`None`].\n This method has a default implementation, so you usually should not\n implement it directly. However, if you can provide a more efficient\n implementation, you can do so. See the [trait-level] docs for an\n example.\n\n This function has the same safety guarantees as the\n [`Iterator::size_hint`] function.\n\n [trait-level]: ExactSizeIterator\n [`Some(T)`]: Some\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n // a finite range knows exactly how many times it will iterate\n let mut range = 0..5;\n\n assert_eq!(5, range.len());\n let _ = range.next();\n assert_eq!(4, range.len());\n ```\n"
