  "doc": " Returns the number of bytes this `char` would need if encoded in UTF-8.\n\n That number of bytes is always between 1 and 4, inclusive.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let len = 'A'.len_utf8();\n assert_eq!(len, 1);\n\n let len = 'ß'.len_utf8();\n assert_eq!(len, 2);\n\n let len = 'ℝ'.len_utf8();\n assert_eq!(len, 3);\n\n let len = '💣'.len_utf8();\n assert_eq!(len, 4);\n ```\n\n The `&str` type guarantees that its contents are UTF-8, and so we can compare the length it\n would take if each code point was represented as a `char` vs in the `&str` itself:\n\n ```\n // as chars\n let eastern = '東';\n let capital = '京';\n\n // both can be represented as three bytes\n assert_eq!(3, eastern.len_utf8());\n assert_eq!(3, capital.len_utf8());\n\n // as a &str, these two are encoded in UTF-8\n let tokyo = \"東京\";\n\n let len = eastern.len_utf8() + capital.len_utf8();\n\n // we can see that they take six bytes total...\n assert_eq!(6, tokyo.len());\n\n // ... just like the &str\n assert_eq!(len, tokyo.len());\n ```\n"
