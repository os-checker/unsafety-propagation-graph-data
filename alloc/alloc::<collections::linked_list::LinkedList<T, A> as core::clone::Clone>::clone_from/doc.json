  "doc": " Overwrites the contents of `self` with a clone of the contents of `source`.\n\n This method is preferred over simply assigning `source.clone()` to `self`,\n as it avoids reallocation of the nodes of the linked list. Additionally,\n if the element type `T` overrides `clone_from()`, this will reuse the\n resources of `self`'s elements as well.\n"
