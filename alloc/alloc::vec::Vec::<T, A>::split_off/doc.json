  "doc": " Splits the collection into two at the given index.\n\n Returns a newly allocated vector containing the elements in the range\n `[at, len)`. After the call, the original vector will be left containing\n the elements `[0, at)` with its previous capacity unchanged.\n\n - If you want to take ownership of the entire contents and capacity of\n   the vector, see [`mem::take`] or [`mem::replace`].\n - If you don't need the returned vector at all, see [`Vec::truncate`].\n - If you want to take ownership of an arbitrary subslice, or you don't\n   necessarily want to store the removed items in a vector, see [`Vec::drain`].\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `at > len`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut vec = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];\n let vec2 = vec.split_off(1);\n assert_eq!(vec, ['a']);\n assert_eq!(vec2, ['b', 'c']);\n ```\n"
