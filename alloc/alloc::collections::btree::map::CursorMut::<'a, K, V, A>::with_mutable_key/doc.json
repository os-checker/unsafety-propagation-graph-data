  "doc": " Converts the cursor into a [`CursorMutKey`], which allows mutating\n the key of elements in the tree.\n\n # Safety\n\n Since this cursor allows mutating keys, you must ensure that the `BTreeMap`\n invariants are maintained. Specifically:\n\n * The key of the newly inserted element must be unique in the tree.\n * All keys in the tree must remain in sorted order.\n"
