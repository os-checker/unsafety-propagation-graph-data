Generally this will be\n exactly the amount of memory necessary, but in principle the allocator\n is free to give back more than we asked for.\n\n If `len` exceeds `self.capacity()`, this may fail to actually allocate\n the requested space. This is not really unsafe, but the unsafe code\n *you* write that relies on the behavior of this function may break.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` _bytes_.\n\n # Aborts\n\n Aborts on OOM.\n"
