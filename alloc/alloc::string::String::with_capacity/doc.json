  "doc": " Creates a new empty `String` with at least the specified capacity.\n\n `String`s have an internal buffer to hold their data. The capacity is\n the length of that buffer, and can be queried with the [`capacity`]\n method. This method creates an empty `String`, but one with an initial\n buffer that can hold at least `capacity` bytes. This is useful when you\n may be appending a bunch of data to the `String`, reducing the number of\n reallocations it needs to do.\n\n [`capacity`]: String::capacity\n\n If the given capacity is `0`, no allocation will occur, and this method\n is identical to the [`new`] method.\n\n [`new`]: String::new\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` _bytes_.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut s = String::with_capacity(10);\n\n // The String contains no chars, even though it has capacity for more\n assert_eq!(s.len(), 0);\n\n // These are all done without reallocating...\n let cap = s.capacity();\n for _ in 0..10 {\n     s.push('a');\n }\n\n assert_eq!(s.capacity(), cap);\n\n // ...but this may make the string reallocate\n s.push('a');\n ```\n"
