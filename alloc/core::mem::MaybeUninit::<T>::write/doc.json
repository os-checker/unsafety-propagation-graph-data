  "doc": " Sets the value of the `MaybeUninit<T>`.\n\n This overwrites any previous value without dropping it, so be careful\n not to use this twice unless you want to skip running the destructor.\n For your convenience, this also returns a mutable reference to the\n (now safely initialized) contents of `self`.\n\n As the content is stored inside a `ManuallyDrop`, the destructor is not\n run for the inner data if the MaybeUninit leaves scope without a call to\n [`assume_init`], [`assume_init_drop`], or similar. Code that receives\n the mutable reference returned by this function needs to keep this in\n mind. The safety model of Rust regards leaks as safe, but they are\n usually still undesirable. This being said, the mutable reference\n behaves like any other mutable reference would, so assigning a new value\n to it will drop the old content.\n\n [`assume_init`]: Self::assume_init\n [`assume_init_drop`]: Self::assume_init_drop\n\n # Examples\n\n Correct usage of this method:\n\n ```rust\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<Vec<u8>>::uninit();\n\n {\n     let hello = x.write((&b\"Hello, world!\").to_vec());\n     // Setting hello does not leak prior allocations, but drops them\n     *hello = (&b\"Hello\").to_vec();\n     hello[0] = 'h' as u8;\n }\n // x is initialized now:\n let s = unsafe { x.assume_init() };\n assert_eq!(b\"hello\", s.as_slice());\n ```\n\n This usage of the method causes a leak:\n\n ```rust\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<String>::uninit();\n\n x.write(\"Hello\".to_string());\n # // FIXME(https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/3670):\n # // use -Zmiri-disable-leak-check instead of unleaking in tests meant to leak.\n # unsafe { MaybeUninit::assume_init_drop(&mut x); }\n // This leaks the contained string:\n x.write(\"hello\".to_string());\n // x is initialized now:\n let s = unsafe { x.assume_init() };\n ```\n\n This method can be used to avoid unsafe in some cases. The example below\n shows a part of an implementation of a fixed sized arena that lends out\n pinned references.\n With `write`, we can avoid the need to write through a raw pointer:\n\n ```rust\n use core::pin::Pin;\n use core::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n struct PinArena<T> {\n     memory: Box<[MaybeUninit<T>]>,\n     len: usize,\n }\n\n impl <T> PinArena<T> {\n     pub fn capacity(&self) -> usize {\n         self.memory.len()\n     }\n     pub fn push(&mut self, val: T) -> Pin<&mut T> {\n         if self.len >= self.capacity() {\n             panic!(\"Attempted to push to a full pin arena!\");\n         }\n         let ref_ = self.memory[self.len].write(val);\n         self.len += 1;\n         unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(ref_) }\n     }\n }\n ```\n"
