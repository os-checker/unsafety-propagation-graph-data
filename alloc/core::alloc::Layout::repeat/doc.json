  "doc": " Creates a layout describing the record for `n` instances of\n `self`, with a suitable amount of padding between each to\n ensure that each instance is given its requested size and\n alignment. On success, returns `(k, offs)` where `k` is the\n layout of the array and `offs` is the distance between the start\n of each element in the array.\n\n (That distance between elements is sometimes known as \"stride\".)\n\n On arithmetic overflow, returns `LayoutError`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(alloc_layout_extra)]\n use std::alloc::Layout;\n\n // All rust types have a size that's a multiple of their alignment.\n let normal = Layout::from_size_align(12, 4).unwrap();\n let repeated = normal.repeat(3).unwrap();\n assert_eq!(repeated, (Layout::from_size_align(36, 4).unwrap(), 12));\n\n // But you can manually make layouts which don't meet that rule.\n let padding_needed = Layout::from_size_align(6, 4).unwrap();\n let repeated = padding_needed.repeat(3).unwrap();\n assert_eq!(repeated, (Layout::from_size_align(24, 4).unwrap(), 8));\n ```\n"
