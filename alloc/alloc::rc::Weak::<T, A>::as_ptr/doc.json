  "doc": " Returns a raw pointer to the object `T` pointed to by this `Weak<T>`.\n\n The pointer is valid only if there are some strong references. The pointer may be dangling,\n unaligned or even [`null`] otherwise.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::rc::Rc;\n use std::ptr;\n\n let strong = Rc::new(\"hello\".to_owned());\n let weak = Rc::downgrade(&strong);\n // Both point to the same object\n assert!(ptr::eq(&*strong, weak.as_ptr()));\n // The strong here keeps it alive, so we can still access the object.\n assert_eq!(\"hello\", unsafe { &*weak.as_ptr() });\n\n drop(strong);\n // But not any more. We can do weak.as_ptr(), but accessing the pointer would lead to\n // undefined behavior.\n // assert_eq!(\"hello\", unsafe { &*weak.as_ptr() });\n ```\n\n [`null`]: ptr::null\n"
