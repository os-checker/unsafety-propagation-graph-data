  "doc": " Reserves the minimum capacity for at least `additional` more elements to be inserted in the\n given deque. Does nothing if the capacity is already sufficient.\n\n Note that the allocator may give the collection more space than it requests. Therefore\n capacity can not be relied upon to be precisely minimal. Prefer [`reserve`] if future\n insertions are expected.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity overflows `usize`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let mut buf: VecDeque<i32> = [1].into();\n buf.reserve_exact(10);\n assert!(buf.capacity() >= 11);\n ```\n\n [`reserve`]: VecDeque::reserve\n"
