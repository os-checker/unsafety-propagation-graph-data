  "doc": " Maps the value in a `UniqueArc`, reusing the allocation if possible.\n\n `f` is called on a reference to the value in the `UniqueArc`, and the result is returned,\n also in a `UniqueArc`.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `UniqueArc::map(u, f)` instead of `u.map(f)`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(smart_pointer_try_map)]\n #![feature(unique_rc_arc)]\n\n use std::sync::UniqueArc;\n\n let r = UniqueArc::new(7);\n let new = UniqueArc::map(r, |i| i + 7);\n assert_eq!(*new, 14);\n ```\n"
