  "doc": " # Safety\n\n This function deallocates the owned allocation, but does not update `ptr` or `cap` to\n prevent double-free or use-after-free. Essentially, do not do anything with the caller\n after this function returns.\n Ideally this function would take `self` by move, but it cannot because it exists to be\n called from a `Drop` impl.\n"
