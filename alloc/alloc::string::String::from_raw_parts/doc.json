  "doc": " Creates a new `String` from a pointer, a length and a capacity.\n\n # Safety\n\n This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren't\n checked:\n\n * all safety requirements for [`Vec::<u8>::from_raw_parts`].\n * all safety requirements for [`String::from_utf8_unchecked`].\n\n Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator's\n internal data structures. For example, it is normally **not** safe to\n build a `String` from a pointer to a C `char` array containing UTF-8\n _unless_ you are certain that array was originally allocated by the\n Rust standard library's allocator.\n\n The ownership of `buf` is effectively transferred to the\n `String` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the\n contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure\n that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this\n function.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n unsafe {\n     let s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n     // Deconstruct the String into parts.\n     let (ptr, len, capacity) = s.into_raw_parts();\n\n     let s = String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, capacity);\n\n     assert_eq!(String::from(\"hello\"), s);\n }\n ```\n"
