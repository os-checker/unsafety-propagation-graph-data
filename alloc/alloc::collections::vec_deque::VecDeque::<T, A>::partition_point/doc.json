  "doc": " Returns the index of the partition point according to the given predicate\n (the index of the first element of the second partition).\n\n The deque is assumed to be partitioned according to the given predicate.\n This means that all elements for which the predicate returns true are at the start of the deque\n and all elements for which the predicate returns false are at the end.\n For example, `[7, 15, 3, 5, 4, 12, 6]` is partitioned under the predicate `x % 2 != 0`\n (all odd numbers are at the start, all even at the end).\n\n If the deque is not partitioned, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless,\n as this method performs a kind of binary search.\n\n See also [`binary_search`], [`binary_search_by`], and [`binary_search_by_key`].\n\n [`binary_search`]: VecDeque::binary_search\n [`binary_search_by`]: VecDeque::binary_search_by\n [`binary_search_by_key`]: VecDeque::binary_search_by_key\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let deque: VecDeque<_> = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7].into();\n let i = deque.partition_point(|&x| x < 5);\n\n assert_eq!(i, 4);\n assert!(deque.iter().take(i).all(|&x| x < 5));\n assert!(deque.iter().skip(i).all(|&x| !(x < 5)));\n ```\n\n If you want to insert an item to a sorted deque, while maintaining\n sort order:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let mut deque: VecDeque<_> = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55].into();\n let num = 42;\n let idx = deque.partition_point(|&x| x < num);\n deque.insert(idx, num);\n assert_eq!(deque, &[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 42, 55]);\n ```\n"
