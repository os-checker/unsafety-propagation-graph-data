  "doc": " Consumes and leaks the `String`, returning a mutable reference to the contents,\n `&'a mut str`.\n\n The caller has free choice over the returned lifetime, including `'static`. Indeed,\n this function is ideally used for data that lives for the remainder of the program's life,\n as dropping the returned reference will cause a memory leak.\n\n It does not reallocate or shrink the `String`, so the leaked allocation may include unused\n capacity that is not part of the returned slice. If you want to discard excess capacity,\n call [`into_boxed_str`], and then [`Box::leak`] instead. However, keep in mind that\n trimming the capacity may result in a reallocation and copy.\n\n [`into_boxed_str`]: Self::into_boxed_str\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = String::from(\"bucket\");\n let static_ref: &'static mut str = x.leak();\n assert_eq!(static_ref, \"bucket\");\n # // FIXME(https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/3670):\n # // use -Zmiri-disable-leak-check instead of unleaking in tests meant to leak.\n # drop(unsafe { Box::from_raw(static_ref) });\n ```\n"
