  "doc": " Removes the subslice indicated by the given range from the vector,\n returning a double-ended iterator over the removed subslice.\n\n If the iterator is dropped before being fully consumed,\n it drops the remaining removed elements.\n\n The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the vector to optimize\n its implementation.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the range has `start_bound > end_bound`, or, if the range is\n bounded on either end and past the length of the vector.\n\n # Leaking\n\n If the returned iterator goes out of scope without being dropped (due to\n [`mem::forget`], for example), the vector may have lost and leaked\n elements arbitrarily, including elements outside the range.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];\n let u: Vec<_> = v.drain(1..).collect();\n assert_eq!(v, &[1]);\n assert_eq!(u, &[2, 3]);\n\n // A full range clears the vector, like `clear()` does\n v.drain(..);\n assert_eq!(v, &[]);\n ```\n"
