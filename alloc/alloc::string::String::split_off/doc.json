  "doc": " Splits the string into two at the given byte index.\n\n Returns a newly allocated `String`. `self` contains bytes `[0, at)`, and\n the returned `String` contains bytes `[at, len)`. `at` must be on the\n boundary of a UTF-8 code point.\n\n Note that the capacity of `self` does not change.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `at` is not on a `UTF-8` code point boundary, or if it is beyond the last\n code point of the string.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n # fn main() {\n let mut hello = String::from(\"Hello, World!\");\n let world = hello.split_off(7);\n assert_eq!(hello, \"Hello, \");\n assert_eq!(world, \"World!\");\n # }\n ```\n"
