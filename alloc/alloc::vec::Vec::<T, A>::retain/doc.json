  "doc": " Retains only the elements specified by the predicate.\n\n In other words, remove all elements `e` for which `f(&e)` returns `false`.\n This method operates in place, visiting each element exactly once in the\n original order, and preserves the order of the retained elements.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n vec.retain(|&x| x % 2 == 0);\n assert_eq!(vec, [2, 4]);\n ```\n\n Because the elements are visited exactly once in the original order,\n external state may be used to decide which elements to keep.\n\n ```\n let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n let keep = [false, true, true, false, true];\n let mut iter = keep.iter();\n vec.retain(|_| *iter.next().unwrap());\n assert_eq!(vec, [2, 3, 5]);\n ```\n"
