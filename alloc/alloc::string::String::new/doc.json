While that means that this initial operation is very\n inexpensive, it may cause excessive allocation later when you add\n data. If you have an idea of how much data the `String` will hold,\n consider the [`with_capacity`] method to prevent excessive\n re-allocation.\n\n [`with_capacity`]: String::with_capacity\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s = String::new();\n ```\n"
