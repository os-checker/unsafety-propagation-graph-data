  "doc": " Finds the distinct leaf edges delimiting a specified range in a tree.\n\n If such distinct edges exist, returns them in ascending order, meaning\n that a non-zero number of calls to `next_unchecked` on the `front` of\n the result and/or calls to `next_back_unchecked` on the `back` of the\n result will eventually reach the same edge.\n\n If there are no such edges, i.e., if the tree contains no key within\n the range, returns an empty `front` and `back`.\n\n # Safety\n Unless `BorrowType` is `Immut`, do not use the handles to visit the same\n KV twice.\n"
