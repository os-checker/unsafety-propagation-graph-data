  "doc": " Removes the specified range from the deque in bulk, returning all\n removed elements as an iterator. If the iterator is dropped before\n being fully consumed, it drops the remaining removed elements.\n\n The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the queue to optimize\n its implementation.\n\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the range has `start_bound > end_bound`, or, if the range is\n bounded on either end and past the length of the deque.\n\n # Leaking\n\n If the returned iterator goes out of scope without being dropped (due to\n [`mem::forget`], for example), the deque may have lost and leaked\n elements arbitrarily, including elements outside the range.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let mut deque: VecDeque<_> = [1, 2, 3].into();\n let drained = deque.drain(2..).collect::<VecDeque<_>>();\n assert_eq!(drained, [3]);\n assert_eq!(deque, [1, 2]);\n\n // A full range clears all contents, like `clear()` does\n deque.drain(..);\n assert!(deque.is_empty());\n ```\n"
