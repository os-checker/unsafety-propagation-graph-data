  "doc": " Writes a length prefix into this hasher, as part of being prefix-free.\n\n If you're implementing [`Hash`] for a custom collection, call this before\n writing its contents to this `Hasher`.  That way\n `(collection![1, 2, 3], collection![4, 5])` and\n `(collection![1, 2], collection![3, 4, 5])` will provide different\n sequences of values to the `Hasher`\n\n The `impl<T> Hash for [T]` includes a call to this method, so if you're\n hashing a slice (or array or vector) via its `Hash::hash` method,\n you should **not** call this yourself.\n\n This method is only for providing domain separation.  If you want to\n hash a `usize` that represents part of the *data*, then it's important\n that you pass it to [`Hasher::write_usize`] instead of to this method.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(hasher_prefixfree_extras)]\n # // Stubs to make the `impl` below pass the compiler\n # #![allow(non_local_definitions)]\n # struct MyCollection<T>(Option<T>);\n # impl<T> MyCollection<T> {\n #     fn len(&self) -> usize { todo!() }\n # }\n # impl<'a, T> IntoIterator for &'a MyCollection<T> {\n #     type Item = T;\n #     type IntoIter = std::iter::Empty<T>;\n #     fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter { todo!() }\n # }\n\n use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};\n impl<T: Hash> Hash for MyCollection<T> {\n     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {\n         state.write_length_prefix(self.len());\n         for elt in self {\n             elt.hash(state);\n         }\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n # Note to Implementers\n\n If you've decided that your `Hasher` is willing to be susceptible to\n Hash-DoS attacks, then you might consider skipping hashing some or all\n of the `len` provided in the name of increased performance.\n"
