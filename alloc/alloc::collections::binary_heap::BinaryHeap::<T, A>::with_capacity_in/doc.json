  "span": "$library/alloc/src/collections/binary_heap/mod.rs:581:5: 581:75",
  "doc": " Creates an empty `BinaryHeap` with at least the specified capacity, using `A` as allocator.\n\n The binary heap will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without\n reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than\n `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the binary heap will not allocate.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::System;\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::with_capacity_in(10, System);\n heap.push(4);\n ```\n"
