(Specifically: it is *legal* to implement\n this trait atop an underlying native allocation library that aborts on memory exhaustion.)\n\n Clients wishing to abort computation in response to an allocation error are encouraged to\n call the [`handle_alloc_error`] function, rather than directly invoking `panic!` or similar.\n\n [`handle_alloc_error`]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html\n"
