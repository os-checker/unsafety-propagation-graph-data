  "doc": " Consumes the `Box`, returning a wrapped `NonNull` pointer.\n\n The pointer will be properly aligned.\n\n After calling this function, the caller is responsible for the\n memory previously managed by the `Box`. In particular, the\n caller should properly destroy `T` and release the memory, taking\n into account the [memory layout] used by `Box`. The easiest way to\n do this is to convert the `NonNull` pointer back into a `Box` with the\n [`Box::from_non_null`] function, allowing the `Box` destructor to\n perform the cleanup.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `Box::into_non_null(b)` instead of `b.into_non_null()`.\n This is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n Converting the `NonNull` pointer back into a `Box` with [`Box::from_non_null`]\n for automatic cleanup:\n ```\n #![feature(box_vec_non_null)]\n\n let x = Box::new(String::from(\"Hello\"));\n let non_null = Box::into_non_null(x);\n let x = unsafe { Box::from_non_null(non_null) };\n ```\n Manual cleanup by explicitly running the destructor and deallocating\n the memory:\n ```\n #![feature(box_vec_non_null)]\n\n use std::alloc::{dealloc, Layout};\n\n let x = Box::new(String::from(\"Hello\"));\n let non_null = Box::into_non_null(x);\n unsafe {\n     non_null.drop_in_place();\n     dealloc(non_null.as_ptr().cast::<u8>(), Layout::new::<String>());\n }\n ```\n Note: This is equivalent to the following:\n ```\n #![feature(box_vec_non_null)]\n\n let x = Box::new(String::from(\"Hello\"));\n let non_null = Box::into_non_null(x);\n unsafe {\n     drop(Box::from_non_null(non_null));\n }\n ```\n\n [memory layout]: self#memory-layout\n"
