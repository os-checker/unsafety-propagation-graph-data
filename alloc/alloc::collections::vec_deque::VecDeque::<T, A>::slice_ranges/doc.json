  "doc": " Given a range into the logical buffer of the deque, this function\n return two ranges into the physical buffer that correspond to\n the given range. The `len` parameter should usually just be `self.len`;\n the reason it's passed explicitly is that if the deque is wrapped in\n a `Drain`, then `self.len` is not actually the length of the deque.\n\n # Safety\n\n This function is always safe to call. For the resulting ranges to be valid\n ranges into the physical buffer, the caller must ensure that the result of\n calling `slice::range(range, ..len)` represents a valid range into the\n logical buffer, and that all elements in that range are initialized.\n"
