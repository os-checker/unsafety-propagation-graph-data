  "doc": " Returns the `n`th element from the end of the iterator.\n\n This is essentially the reversed version of [`Iterator::nth()`].\n Although like most indexing operations, the count starts from zero, so\n `nth_back(0)` returns the first value from the end, `nth_back(1)` the\n second, and so on.\n\n Note that all elements between the end and the returned element will be\n consumed, including the returned element. This also means that calling\n `nth_back(0)` multiple times on the same iterator will return different\n elements.\n\n `nth_back()` will return [`None`] if `n` is greater than or equal to the\n length of the iterator.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n assert_eq!(a.iter().nth_back(2), Some(&1));\n ```\n\n Calling `nth_back()` multiple times doesn't rewind the iterator:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.iter();\n\n assert_eq!(iter.nth_back(1), Some(&2));\n assert_eq!(iter.nth_back(1), None);\n ```\n\n Returning `None` if there are less than `n + 1` elements:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n assert_eq!(a.iter().nth_back(10), None);\n ```\n"
