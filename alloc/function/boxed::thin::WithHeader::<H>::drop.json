      "doc": " Executes the destructor (if any) of the pointed-to value.\n\n This is almost the same as calling [`ptr::read`] and discarding\n the result, but has the following advantages:\n\n * It is *required* to use `drop_in_place` to drop unsized types like\n   trait objects, because they can't be read out onto the stack and\n   dropped normally.\n\n * It is friendlier to the optimizer to do this over [`ptr::read`] when\n   dropping manually allocated memory (e.g., in the implementations of\n   `Box`/`Rc`/`Vec`), as the compiler doesn't need to prove that it's\n   sound to elide the copy.\n\n * It can be used to drop [pinned] data when `T` is not `repr(packed)`\n   (pinned data must not be moved before it is dropped).\n\n Unaligned values cannot be dropped in place, they must be copied to an aligned\n location first using [`ptr::read_unaligned`]. For packed structs, this move is\n done automatically by the compiler. This means the fields of packed structs\n are not dropped in-place.\n\n [`ptr::read`]: self::read\n [`ptr::read_unaligned`]: self::read_unaligned\n [pinned]: crate::pin\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `to_drop` must be [valid] for both reads and writes.\n\n * `to_drop` must be properly aligned, even if `T` has size 0.\n\n * `to_drop` must be nonnull, even if `T` has size 0.\n\n * The value `to_drop` points to must be valid for dropping, which may mean\n   it must uphold additional invariants. These invariants depend on the type\n   of the value being dropped. For instance, when dropping a Box, the box's\n   pointer to the heap must be valid.\n\n * While `drop_in_place` is executing, the only way to access parts of\n   `to_drop` is through the `&mut self` references supplied to the\n   `Drop::drop` methods that `drop_in_place` invokes.\n\n Additionally, if `T` is not [`Copy`], using the pointed-to value after\n calling `drop_in_place` can cause undefined behavior. Note that `*to_drop =\n foo` counts as a use because it will cause the value to be dropped\n again. [`write()`] can be used to overwrite data without causing it to be\n dropped.\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Manually remove the last item from a vector:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n use std::rc::Rc;\n\n let last = Rc::new(1);\n let weak = Rc::downgrade(&last);\n\n let mut v = vec![Rc::new(0), last];\n\n unsafe {\n     // Get a raw pointer to the last element in `v`.\n     let ptr = &mut v[1] as *mut _;\n     // Shorten `v` to prevent the last item from being dropped. We do that first,\n     // to prevent issues if the `drop_in_place` below panics.\n     v.set_len(1);\n     // Without a call `drop_in_place`, the last item would never be dropped,\n     // and the memory it manages would be leaked.\n     ptr::drop_in_place(ptr);\n }\n\n assert_eq!(v, &[0.into()]);\n\n // Ensure that the last item was dropped.\n assert!(weak.upgrade().is_none());\n ```\n",
