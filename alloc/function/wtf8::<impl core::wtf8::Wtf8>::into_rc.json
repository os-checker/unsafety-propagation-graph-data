This\n   is trivially true if `U` is `T`.\n * If `U` is unsized, its data pointer must have the same size and\n   alignment as `T`. This is trivially true if `Rc<U>` was constructed\n   through `Rc<T>` and then converted to `Rc<U>` through an [unsized\n   coercion].\n\n Note that if `U` or `U`'s data pointer is not `T` but has the same size\n and alignment, this is basically like transmuting references of\n different types. See [`mem::transmute`][transmute] for more information\n on what restrictions apply in this case.\n\n The raw pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by the global allocator\n\n The user of `from_raw` has to make sure a specific value of `T` is only\n dropped once.\n\n This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to memory unsafety,\n even if the returned `Rc<T>` is never accessed.\n\n [into_raw]: Rc::into_raw\n [transmute]: core::mem::transmute\n [unsized coercion]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-coercions.html#unsized-coercions\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::rc::Rc;\n\n let x = Rc::new(\"hello\".to_owned());\n let x_ptr = Rc::into_raw(x);\n\n unsafe {\n     // Convert back to an `Rc` to prevent leak.\n     let x = Rc::from_raw(x_ptr);\n     assert_eq!(&*x, \"hello\");\n\n     // Further calls to `Rc::from_raw(x_ptr)` would be memory-unsafe.\n }\n\n // The memory was freed when `x` went out of scope above, so `x_ptr` is now dangling!\n ```\n\n Convert a slice back into its original array:\n\n ```\n use std::rc::Rc;\n\n let x: Rc<[u32]> = Rc::new([1, 2, 3]);\n let x_ptr: *const [u32] = Rc::into_raw(x);\n\n unsafe {\n     let x: Rc<[u32; 3]> = Rc::from_raw(x_ptr.cast::<[u32; 3]>());\n     assert_eq!(&*x, &[1, 2, 3]);\n }\n ```\n",
