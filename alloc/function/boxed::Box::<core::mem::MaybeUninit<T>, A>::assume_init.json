In particular, the\n caller should properly destroy `T` and release the memory, taking\n into account the [memory layout] used by `Box`. The easiest way to\n do this is to convert the raw pointer back into a `Box` with the\n [`Box::from_raw_in`] function, allowing the `Box` destructor to perform\n the cleanup.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `Box::into_raw_with_allocator(b)` instead of `b.into_raw_with_allocator()`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n Converting the raw pointer back into a `Box` with [`Box::from_raw_in`]\n for automatic cleanup:\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::System;\n\n let x = Box::new_in(String::from(\"Hello\"), System);\n let (ptr, alloc) = Box::into_raw_with_allocator(x);\n let x = unsafe { Box::from_raw_in(ptr, alloc) };\n ```\n Manual cleanup by explicitly running the destructor and deallocating\n the memory:\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::{Allocator, Layout, System};\n use std::ptr::{self, NonNull};\n\n let x = Box::new_in(String::from(\"Hello\"), System);\n let (ptr, alloc) = Box::into_raw_with_allocator(x);\n unsafe {\n     ptr::drop_in_place(ptr);\n     let non_null = NonNull::new_unchecked(ptr);\n     alloc.deallocate(non_null.cast(), Layout::new::<String>());\n }\n ```\n\n [memory layout]: self#memory-layout\n",
