The pointer is suitable for holding data described by `new_layout`. To accomplish\n this, the allocator may shrink the allocation referenced by `ptr` to fit the new layout.\n\n If this returns `Ok`, then ownership of the memory block referenced by `ptr` has been\n transferred to this allocator. Any access to the old `ptr` is Undefined Behavior, even if the\n allocation was shrunk in-place. The newly returned pointer is the only valid pointer\n for accessing this memory now.\n\n If this method returns `Err`, then ownership of the memory block has not been transferred to\n this allocator, and the contents of the memory block are unaltered.\n\n # Safety\n\n * `ptr` must denote a block of memory [*currently allocated*] via this allocator.\n * `old_layout` must [*fit*] that block of memory (The `new_layout` argument need not fit it.).\n * `new_layout.size()` must be smaller than or equal to `old_layout.size()`.\n\n Note that `new_layout.align()` need not be the same as `old_layout.align()`.\n\n [*currently allocated*]: #currently-allocated-memory\n [*fit*]: #memory-fitting\n\n # Errors\n\n Returns `Err` if the new layout does not meet the allocator's size and alignment\n constraints of the allocator, or if shrinking otherwise fails.\n\n Implementations are encouraged to return `Err` on memory exhaustion rather than panicking or\n aborting, but this is not a strict requirement. (Specifically: it is *legal* to implement\n this trait atop an underlying native allocation library that aborts on memory exhaustion.)\n\n Clients wishing to abort computation in response to an allocation error are encouraged to\n call the [`handle_alloc_error`] function, rather than directly invoking `panic!` or similar.\n\n [`handle_alloc_error`]: ../../alloc/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html\n",
