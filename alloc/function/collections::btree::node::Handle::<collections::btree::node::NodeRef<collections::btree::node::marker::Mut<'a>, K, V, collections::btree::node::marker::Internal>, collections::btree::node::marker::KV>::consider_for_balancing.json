This leaves the\n memory in `src` unchanged.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `src` must be [valid] for reads.\n\n * `src` must be properly aligned. Use [`read_unaligned`] if this is not the\n   case.\n\n * `src` must point to a properly initialized value of type `T`.\n\n Note that even if `T` has size `0`, the pointer must be properly aligned.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let x = 12;\n let y = &x as *const i32;\n\n unsafe {\n     assert_eq!(std::ptr::read(y), 12);\n }\n ```\n\n Manually implement [`mem::swap`]:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n fn swap<T>(a: &mut T, b: &mut T) {\n     unsafe {\n         // Create a bitwise copy of the value at `a` in `tmp`.\n         let tmp = ptr::read(a);\n\n         // Exiting at this point (either by explicitly returning or by\n         // calling a function which panics) would cause the value in `tmp` to\n         // be dropped while the same value is still referenced by `a`.

Note that assigning to `*src` counts as a\n use because it will attempt to drop the value at `*src`.\n\n [`write()`] can be used to overwrite data without causing it to be dropped.\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let mut s = String::from(\"foo\");\n unsafe {\n     // `s2` now points to the same underlying memory as `s`.\n     let mut s2: String = ptr::read(&s);\n\n     assert_eq!(s2, \"foo\");\n\n     // Assigning to `s2` causes its original value to be dropped.
