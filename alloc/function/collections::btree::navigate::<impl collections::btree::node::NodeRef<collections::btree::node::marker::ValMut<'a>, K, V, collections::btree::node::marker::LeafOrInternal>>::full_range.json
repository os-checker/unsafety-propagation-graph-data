This leaves the\n memory in `src` unchanged.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `src` must be [valid] for reads.\n\n * `src` must be properly aligned. Use [`read_unaligned`] if this is not the\n   case.\n\n * `src` must point to a properly initialized value of type `T`.\n\n Note that even if `T` has size `0`, the pointer must be properly aligned.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let x = 12;\n let y = &x as *const i32;\n\n unsafe {\n     assert_eq!(std::ptr::read(y), 12);\n }\n ```\n\n Manually implement [`mem::swap`]:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n fn swap<T>(a: &mut T, b: &mut T) {\n     unsafe {\n         // Create a bitwise copy of the value at `a` in `tmp`.\n         let tmp = ptr::read(a);\n\n         // Exiting at this point (either by explicitly returning or by\n         // calling a function which panics) would cause the value in `tmp` to\n         // be dropped while the same value is still referenced by `a`. This\n         // could trigger undefined behavior if `T` is not `Copy`.\n\n         // Create a bitwise copy of the value at `b` in `a`.\n         // This is safe because mutable references cannot alias.\n         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(b, a, 1);\n\n         // As above, exiting here could trigger undefined behavior because\n         // the same value is referenced by `a` and `b`.\n\n         // Move `tmp` into `b`.\n         ptr::write(b, tmp);\n\n         // `tmp` has been moved (`write` takes ownership of its second argument),\n         // so nothing is dropped implicitly here.\n     }\n }\n\n let mut foo = \"foo\".to_owned();\n let mut bar = \"bar\".to_owned();\n\n swap(&mut foo, &mut bar);\n\n assert_eq!(foo, \"bar\");\n assert_eq!(bar, \"foo\");\n ```\n\n ## Ownership of the Returned Value\n\n `read` creates a bitwise copy of `T`, regardless of whether `T` is [`Copy`].\n If `T` is not [`Copy`], using both the returned value and the value at\n `*src` can violate memory safety. Note that assigning to `*src` counts as a\n use because it will attempt to drop the value at `*src`.\n\n [`write()`] can be used to overwrite data without causing it to be dropped.\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let mut s = String::from(\"foo\");\n unsafe {\n     // `s2` now points to the same underlying memory as `s`.\n     let mut s2: String = ptr::read(&s);\n\n     assert_eq!(s2, \"foo\");\n\n     // Assigning to `s2` causes its original value to be dropped. Beyond\n     // this point, `s` must no longer be used, as the underlying memory has\n     // been freed.\n     s2 = String::default();\n     assert_eq!(s2, \"\");\n\n     // Assigning to `s` would cause the old value to be dropped again,\n     // resulting in undefined behavior.\n     // s = String::from(\"bar\"); // ERROR\n\n     // `ptr::write` can be used to overwrite a value without dropping it.\n     ptr::write(&mut s, String::from(\"bar\"));\n }\n\n assert_eq!(s, \"bar\");\n ```\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n",
