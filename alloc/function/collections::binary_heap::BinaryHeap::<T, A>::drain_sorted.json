If the iterator is dropped before being fully consumed,\n it drops the remaining elements in heap order.\n\n The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the heap to optimize\n its implementation.\n\n Note:\n * `.drain_sorted()` is *O*(*n* \\* log(*n*)); much slower than `.drain()`.\n   You should use the latter for most cases.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n #![feature(binary_heap_drain_sorted)]\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n assert_eq!(heap.len(), 5);\n\n drop(heap.drain_sorted()); // removes all elements in heap order\n assert_eq!(heap.len(), 0);\n ```\n",
