      "doc": " Creates a `Vec<T>` directly from a pointer, a length, and a capacity.\n\n # Safety\n\n This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren't\n checked:\n\n * If `T` is not a zero-sized type and the capacity is nonzero, `ptr` must have\n   been allocated using the global allocator, such as via the [`alloc::alloc`]\n   function. If `T` is a zero-sized type or the capacity is zero, `ptr` need\n   only be non-null and aligned.\n * `T` needs to have the same alignment as what `ptr` was allocated with,\n   if the pointer is required to be allocated.\n   (`T` having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really\n   needs to be equal to satisfy the [`dealloc`] requirement that memory must be\n   allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)\n * The size of `T` times the `capacity` (ie. the allocated size in bytes), if\n   nonzero, needs to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with.\n   (Because similar to alignment, [`dealloc`] must be called with the same\n   layout `size`.)\n * `length` needs to be less than or equal to `capacity`.\n * The first `length` values must be properly initialized values of type `T`.\n * `capacity` needs to be the capacity that the pointer was allocated with,\n   if the pointer is required to be allocated.\n * The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`.\n   See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].\n\n These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been allocated\n via `Vec<T>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are\n upheld.\n\n Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator's\n internal data structures. For example it is normally **not** safe\n to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length\n `size_t`, doing so is only safe if the array was initially allocated by\n a `Vec` or `String`.\n It's also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because\n the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different\n alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after\n turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it'll be deallocated with alignment 1. To avoid\n these issues, it is often preferable to do casting/transmuting using\n [`slice::from_raw_parts`] instead.\n\n The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the\n `Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the\n contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure\n that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this\n function.\n\n [`String`]: crate::string::String\n [`alloc::alloc`]: crate::alloc::alloc\n [`dealloc`]: crate::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n let v = vec![1, 2, 3];\n\n // Deconstruct the vector into parts.\n let (p, len, cap) = v.into_raw_parts();\n\n unsafe {\n     // Overwrite memory with 4, 5, 6\n     for i in 0..len {\n         ptr::write(p.add(i), 4 + i);\n     }\n\n     // Put everything back together into a Vec\n     let rebuilt = Vec::from_raw_parts(p, len, cap);\n     assert_eq!(rebuilt, [4, 5, 6]);\n }\n ```\n\n Using memory that was allocated elsewhere:\n\n ```rust\n use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};\n\n fn main() {\n     let layout = Layout::array::<u32>(16).expect(\"overflow cannot happen\");\n\n     let vec = unsafe {\n         let mem = alloc(layout).cast::<u32>();\n         if mem.is_null() {\n             return;\n         }\n\n         mem.write(1_000_000);\n\n         Vec::from_raw_parts(mem, 1, 16)\n     };\n\n     assert_eq!(vec, &[1_000_000]);\n     assert_eq!(vec.capacity(), 16);\n }\n ```\n",
