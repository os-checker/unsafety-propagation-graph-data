This is safe, but it could leak\n allocations or resources, so care should be taken not to overwrite an object\n that should be dropped.\n\n Additionally, it does not drop `src`. Semantically, `src` is moved into the\n location pointed to by `dst`.\n\n This is appropriate for initializing uninitialized memory, or overwriting\n memory that has previously been [`read`] from.\n\n # Safety\n\n Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:\n\n * `dst` must be [valid] for writes.\n\n * `dst` must be properly aligned. Use [`write_unaligned`] if this is not the\n   case.\n\n Note that even if `T` has size `0`, the pointer must be properly aligned.\n\n [valid]: self#safety\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let mut x = 0;\n let y = &mut x as *mut i32;\n let z = 12;\n\n unsafe {\n     std::ptr::write(y, z);\n     assert_eq!(std::ptr::read(y), 12);\n }\n ```\n\n Manually implement [`mem::swap`]:\n\n ```\n use std::ptr;\n\n fn swap<T>(a: &mut T, b: &mut T) {\n     unsafe {\n         // Create a bitwise copy of the value at `a` in `tmp`.\n         let tmp = ptr::read(a);\n\n         // Exiting at this point (either by explicitly returning or by\n         // calling a function which panics) would cause the value in `tmp` to\n         // be dropped while the same value is still referenced by `a`. This\n         // could trigger undefined behavior if `T` is not `Copy`.\n\n         // Create a bitwise copy of the value at `b` in `a`.\n         // This is safe because mutable references cannot alias.\n         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(b, a, 1);\n\n         // As above, exiting here could trigger undefined behavior because\n         // the same value is referenced by `a` and `b`.\n\n         // Move `tmp` into `b`.\n         ptr::write(b, tmp);\n\n         // `tmp` has been moved (`write` takes ownership of its second argument),\n         // so nothing is dropped implicitly here.\n     }\n }\n\n let mut foo = \"foo\".to_owned();\n let mut bar = \"bar\".to_owned();\n\n swap(&mut foo, &mut bar);\n\n assert_eq!(foo, \"bar\");\n assert_eq!(bar, \"foo\");\n ```\n",
