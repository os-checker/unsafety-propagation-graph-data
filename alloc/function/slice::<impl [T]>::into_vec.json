In particular, the\n caller should properly destroy `T` and release the memory, taking\n into account the [memory layout] used by `Box`. The easiest way to\n do this is to convert the raw pointer back into a `Box` with the\n [`Box::from_raw_in`] function, allowing the `Box` destructor to perform\n the cleanup.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `Box::into_raw_with_allocator(b)` instead of `b.into_raw_with_allocator()`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n Converting the raw pointer back into a `Box` with [`Box::from_raw_in`]\n for automatic cleanup:\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::System;\n\n let x = Box::new_in(String::from(\"Hello\"), System);\n let (ptr, alloc) = Box::into_raw_with_allocator(x);\n let x = unsafe { Box::from_raw_in(ptr, alloc) };\n ```\n Manual cleanup by explicitly running the destructor and deallocating\n the memory:\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::{Allocator, Layout, System};\n use std::ptr::{self, NonNull};\n\n let x = Box::new_in(String::from(\"Hello\"), System);\n let (ptr, alloc) = Box::into_raw_with_allocator(x);\n unsafe {\n     ptr::drop_in_place(ptr);\n     let non_null = NonNull::new_unchecked(ptr);\n     alloc.deallocate(non_null.cast(), Layout::new::<String>());\n }\n ```\n\n [memory layout]: self#memory-layout\n",

      "doc": " Creates a `Vec<T, A>` directly from a pointer, a length, a capacity,\n and an allocator.\n\n # Safety\n\n This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren't\n checked:\n\n * `ptr` must be [*currently allocated*] via the given allocator `alloc`.\n * `T` needs to have the same alignment as what `ptr` was allocated with.\n   (`T` having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really\n   needs to be equal to satisfy the [`dealloc`] requirement that memory must be\n   allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)\n * The size of `T` times the `capacity` (ie. the allocated size in bytes) needs\n   to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to\n   alignment, [`dealloc`] must be called with the same layout `size`.)\n * `length` needs to be less than or equal to `capacity`.\n * The first `length` values must be properly initialized values of type `T`.\n * `capacity` needs to [*fit*] the layout size that the pointer was allocated with.\n * The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`.\n   See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].\n\n These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been allocated\n via `Vec<T, A>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are\n upheld.\n\n Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator's\n internal data structures. For example it is **not** safe\n to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length `size_t`.\n It's also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because\n the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different\n alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after\n turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it'll be deallocated with alignment 1.\n\n The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the\n `Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the\n contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure\n that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this\n function.\n\n [`String`]: crate::string::String\n [`dealloc`]: crate::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc\n [*currently allocated*]: crate::alloc::Allocator#currently-allocated-memory\n [*fit*]: crate::alloc::Allocator#memory-fitting\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::System;\n\n use std::ptr;\n\n let mut v = Vec::with_capacity_in(3, System);\n v.push(1);\n v.push(2);\n v.push(3);\n\n // Deconstruct the vector into parts.\n let (p, len, cap, alloc) = v.into_raw_parts_with_alloc();\n\n unsafe {\n     // Overwrite memory with 4, 5, 6\n     for i in 0..len {\n         ptr::write(p.add(i), 4 + i);\n     }\n\n     // Put everything back together into a Vec\n     let rebuilt = Vec::from_raw_parts_in(p, len, cap, alloc.clone());\n     assert_eq!(rebuilt, [4, 5, 6]);\n }\n ```\n\n Using memory that was allocated elsewhere:\n\n ```rust\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::{AllocError, Allocator, Global, Layout};\n\n fn main() {\n     let layout = Layout::array::<u32>(16).expect(\"overflow cannot happen\");\n\n     let vec = unsafe {\n         let mem = match Global.allocate(layout) {\n             Ok(mem) => mem.cast::<u32>().as_ptr(),\n             Err(AllocError) => return,\n         };\n\n         mem.write(1_000_000);\n\n         Vec::from_raw_parts_in(mem, 1, 16, Global)\n     };\n\n     assert_eq!(vec, &[1_000_000]);\n     assert_eq!(vec.capacity(), 16);\n }\n ```\n",
