In this case, the future's underlying\n computation is simply acting as a conduit for a value being computed\n by that other task, which will proceed independently of the Future.\n Futures of this kind are typically obtained when spawning a new task into an\n async runtime.\n\n The `poll` function should not be called repeatedly in a tight loop --\n instead, it should only be called when the future indicates that it is\n ready to make progress (by calling `wake()`). If you're familiar with the\n `poll(2)` or `select(2)` syscalls on Unix it's worth noting that futures\n typically do *not* suffer the same problems of \"all wakeups must poll\n all events\"; they are more like `epoll(4)`.\n\n An implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and should\n not block. Returning quickly prevents unnecessarily clogging up\n threads or event loops. If it is known ahead of time that a call to\n `poll` may end up taking a while, the work should be offloaded to a\n thread pool (or something similar) to ensure that `poll` can return\n quickly.\n\n # Panics\n\n Once a future has completed (returned `Ready` from `poll`), calling its\n `poll` method again may panic, block forever, or cause other kinds of\n problems; the `Future` trait places no requirements on the effects of\n such a call. However, as the `poll` method is not marked `unsafe`,\n Rust's usual rules apply: calls must never cause undefined behavior\n (memory corruption, incorrect use of `unsafe` functions, or the like),\n regardless of the future's state.\n\n [`Poll::Ready(val)`]: Poll::Ready\n [`Waker`]: crate::task::Waker\n [`Waker::wake`]: crate::task::Waker::wake\n",
