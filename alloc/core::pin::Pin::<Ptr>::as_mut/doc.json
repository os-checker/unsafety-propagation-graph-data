  "doc": " Gets a mutable reference to the pinned value this `Pin<Ptr>` points to.\n\n This is a generic method to go from `&mut Pin<Pointer<T>>` to `Pin<&mut T>`.\n It is safe because, as part of the contract of `Pin::new_unchecked`,\n the pointee cannot move after `Pin<Pointer<T>>` got created.\n \"Malicious\" implementations of `Pointer::DerefMut` are likewise\n ruled out by the contract of `Pin::new_unchecked`.\n\n This method is useful when doing multiple calls to functions that consume the\n pinning pointer.\n\n # Example\n\n ```\n use std::pin::Pin;\n\n # struct Type {}\n impl Type {\n     fn method(self: Pin<&mut Self>) {\n         // do something\n     }\n\n     fn call_method_twice(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>) {\n         // `method` consumes `self`, so reborrow the `Pin<&mut Self>` via `as_mut`.\n         self.as_mut().method();\n         self.as_mut().method();\n     }\n }\n ```\n"
