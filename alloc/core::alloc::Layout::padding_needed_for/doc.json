  "doc": " Returns the amount of padding we must insert after `self`\n to ensure that the following address will satisfy `align`\n (measured in bytes).\n\n e.g., if `self.size()` is 9, then `self.padding_needed_for(4)`\n returns 3, because that is the minimum number of bytes of\n padding required to get a 4-aligned address (assuming that the\n corresponding memory block starts at a 4-aligned address).\n\n The return value of this function has no meaning if `align` is\n not a power-of-two.\n\n Note that the utility of the returned value requires `align`\n to be less than or equal to the alignment of the starting\n address for the whole allocated block of memory. One way to\n satisfy this constraint is to ensure `align <= self.align()`.\n"
