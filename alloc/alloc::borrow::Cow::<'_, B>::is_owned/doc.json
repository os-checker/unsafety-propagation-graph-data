  "doc": " Returns true if the data is owned, i.e. if `to_mut` would be a no-op.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have to call\n it as `Cow::is_owned(&c)` instead of `c.is_owned()`. This is so that\n there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(cow_is_borrowed)]\n use std::borrow::Cow;\n\n let cow: Cow<'_, str> = Cow::Owned(\"moo\".to_string());\n assert!(Cow::is_owned(&cow));\n\n let bull = Cow::Borrowed(\"...moo?\");\n assert!(!Cow::is_owned(&bull));\n ```\n"
