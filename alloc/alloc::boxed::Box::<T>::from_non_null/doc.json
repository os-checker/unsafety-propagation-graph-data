  "doc": " Constructs a box from a `NonNull` pointer.\n\n After calling this function, the `NonNull` pointer is owned by\n the resulting `Box`. Specifically, the `Box` destructor will call\n the destructor of `T` and free the allocated memory. For this\n to be safe, the memory must have been allocated in accordance\n with the [memory layout] used by `Box` .\n\n # Safety\n\n This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to\n memory problems. For example, a double-free may occur if the\n function is called twice on the same `NonNull` pointer.\n\n The non-null pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by the global allocator.\n\n The safety conditions are described in the [memory layout] section.\n\n # Examples\n\n Recreate a `Box` which was previously converted to a `NonNull`\n pointer using [`Box::into_non_null`]:\n ```\n #![feature(box_vec_non_null)]\n\n let x = Box::new(5);\n let non_null = Box::into_non_null(x);\n let x = unsafe { Box::from_non_null(non_null) };\n ```\n Manually create a `Box` from scratch by using the global allocator:\n ```\n #![feature(box_vec_non_null)]\n\n use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};\n use std::ptr::NonNull;\n\n unsafe {\n     let non_null = NonNull::new(alloc(Layout::new::<i32>()).cast::<i32>())\n         .expect(\"allocation failed\");\n     // In general .write is required to avoid attempting to destruct\n     // the (uninitialized) previous contents of `non_null`.\n     non_null.write(5);\n     let x = Box::from_non_null(non_null);\n }\n ```\n\n [memory layout]: self#memory-layout\n"
