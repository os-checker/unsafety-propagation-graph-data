  "doc": " Clears the binary heap, returning an iterator over the removed elements\n in heap order. If the iterator is dropped before being fully consumed,\n it drops the remaining elements in heap order.\n\n The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the heap to optimize\n its implementation.\n\n Note:\n * `.drain_sorted()` is *O*(*n* \\* log(*n*)); much slower than `.drain()`.\n   You should use the latter for most cases.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n #![feature(binary_heap_drain_sorted)]\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n assert_eq!(heap.len(), 5);\n\n drop(heap.drain_sorted()); // removes all elements in heap order\n assert_eq!(heap.len(), 0);\n ```\n"
