  "doc": " Removes the specified range from the string in bulk, returning all\n removed characters as an iterator.\n\n The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the string to optimize\n its implementation.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the range has `start_bound > end_bound`, or, if the range is\n bounded on either end and does not lie on a [`char`] boundary.\n\n # Leaking\n\n If the returned iterator goes out of scope without being dropped (due to\n [`core::mem::forget`], for example), the string may still contain a copy\n of any drained characters, or may have lost characters arbitrarily,\n including characters outside the range.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut s = String::from(\"α is alpha, β is beta\");\n let beta_offset = s.find('β').unwrap_or(s.len());\n\n // Remove the range up until the β from the string\n let t: String = s.drain(..beta_offset).collect();\n assert_eq!(t, \"α is alpha, \");\n assert_eq!(s, \"β is beta\");\n\n // A full range clears the string, like `clear()` does\n s.drain(..);\n assert_eq!(s, \"\");\n ```\n"
