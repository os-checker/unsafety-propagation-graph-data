  "doc": " Returns a reference to the next() value without advancing the iterator.\n\n Like [`next`], if there is a value, it is wrapped in a `Some(T)`.\n But if the iteration is over, `None` is returned.\n\n [`next`]: Iterator::next\n\n Because `peek()` returns a reference, and many iterators iterate over\n references, there can be a possibly confusing situation where the\n return value is a double reference. You can see this effect in the\n examples below.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let xs = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = xs.iter().peekable();\n\n // peek() lets us see into the future\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), Some(&&1));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&1));\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&2));\n\n // The iterator does not advance even if we `peek` multiple times\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), Some(&&3));\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), Some(&&3));\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&3));\n\n // After the iterator is finished, so is `peek()`\n assert_eq!(iter.peek(), None);\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n"
