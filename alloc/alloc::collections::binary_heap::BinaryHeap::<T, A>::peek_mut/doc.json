  "doc": " Returns a mutable reference to the greatest item in the binary heap, or\n `None` if it is empty.\n\n Note: If the `PeekMut` value is leaked, some heap elements might get\n leaked along with it, but the remaining elements will remain a valid\n heap.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();\n assert!(heap.peek_mut().is_none());\n\n heap.push(1);\n heap.push(5);\n heap.push(2);\n if let Some(mut val) = heap.peek_mut() {\n     *val = 0;\n }\n assert_eq!(heap.peek(), Some(&2));\n ```\n\n # Time complexity\n\n If the item is modified then the worst case time complexity is *O*(log(*n*)),\n otherwise it's *O*(1).\n"
