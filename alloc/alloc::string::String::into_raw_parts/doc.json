  "doc": " Decomposes a `String` into its raw components: `(pointer, length, capacity)`.\n\n Returns the raw pointer to the underlying data, the length of\n the string (in bytes), and the allocated capacity of the data\n (in bytes). These are the same arguments in the same order as\n the arguments to [`from_raw_parts`].\n\n After calling this function, the caller is responsible for the\n memory previously managed by the `String`. The only way to do\n this is to convert the raw pointer, length, and capacity back\n into a `String` with the [`from_raw_parts`] function, allowing\n the destructor to perform the cleanup.\n\n [`from_raw_parts`]: String::from_raw_parts\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n let (ptr, len, cap) = s.into_raw_parts();\n\n let rebuilt = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, cap) };\n assert_eq!(rebuilt, \"hello\");\n ```\n"
