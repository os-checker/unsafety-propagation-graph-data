  "doc": " Binary searches this `VecDeque` with a comparator function.\n\n The comparator function should return an order code that indicates\n whether its argument is `Less`, `Equal` or `Greater` the desired\n target.\n If the `VecDeque` is not sorted or if the comparator function does not\n implement an order consistent with the sort order of the underlying\n `VecDeque`, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless.\n\n If the value is found then [`Result::Ok`] is returned, containing the\n index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any\n one of the matches could be returned. If the value is not found then\n [`Result::Err`] is returned, containing the index where a matching\n element could be inserted while maintaining sorted order.\n\n See also [`binary_search`], [`binary_search_by_key`], and [`partition_point`].\n\n [`binary_search`]: VecDeque::binary_search\n [`binary_search_by_key`]: VecDeque::binary_search_by_key\n [`partition_point`]: VecDeque::partition_point\n\n # Examples\n\n Looks up a series of four elements. The first is found, with a\n uniquely determined position; the second and third are not\n found; the fourth could match any position in `[1, 4]`.\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let deque: VecDeque<_> = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55].into();\n\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search_by(|x| x.cmp(&13)),  Ok(9));\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search_by(|x| x.cmp(&4)),   Err(7));\n assert_eq!(deque.binary_search_by(|x| x.cmp(&100)), Err(13));\n let r = deque.binary_search_by(|x| x.cmp(&1));\n assert!(matches!(r, Ok(1..=4)));\n ```\n"
