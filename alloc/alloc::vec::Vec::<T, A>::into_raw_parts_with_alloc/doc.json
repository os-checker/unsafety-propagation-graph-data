  "doc": " Decomposes a `Vec<T>` into its raw components: `(pointer, length, capacity, allocator)`.\n\n Returns the raw pointer to the underlying data, the length of the vector (in elements),\n the allocated capacity of the data (in elements), and the allocator. These are the same\n arguments in the same order as the arguments to [`from_raw_parts_in`].\n\n After calling this function, the caller is responsible for the\n memory previously managed by the `Vec`. The only way to do\n this is to convert the raw pointer, length, and capacity back\n into a `Vec` with the [`from_raw_parts_in`] function, allowing\n the destructor to perform the cleanup.\n\n [`from_raw_parts_in`]: Vec::from_raw_parts_in\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(allocator_api)]\n\n use std::alloc::System;\n\n let mut v: Vec<i32, System> = Vec::new_in(System);\n v.push(-1);\n v.push(0);\n v.push(1);\n\n let (ptr, len, cap, alloc) = v.into_raw_parts_with_alloc();\n\n let rebuilt = unsafe {\n     // We can now make changes to the components, such as\n     // transmuting the raw pointer to a compatible type.\n     let ptr = ptr as *mut u32;\n\n     Vec::from_raw_parts_in(ptr, len, cap, alloc)\n };\n assert_eq!(rebuilt, [4294967295, 0, 1]);\n ```\n"
