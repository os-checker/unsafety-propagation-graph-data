If this constraint is violated, it may cause\n memory unsafety issues with future users of the `String`, as the rest of\n the standard library assumes that `String`s are valid UTF-8.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // some bytes, in a vector\n let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];\n\n let sparkle_heart = unsafe {\n     String::from_utf8_unchecked(sparkle_heart)\n };\n\n assert_eq!(\"💖\", sparkle_heart);\n ```\n"
