  "doc": " Attempts to map the value in a box, reusing the allocation if possible.\n\n `f` is called on the value in the box, and if the operation succeeds, the result is\n returned, also boxed.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `Box::try_map(b, f)` instead of `b.try_map(f)`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(smart_pointer_try_map)]\n\n let b = Box::new(7);\n let new = Box::try_map(b, u32::try_from).unwrap();\n assert_eq!(*new, 7);\n ```\n"
