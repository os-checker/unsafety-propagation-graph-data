  "doc": " Creates a splicing iterator that replaces the specified range in the vector\n with the given `replace_with` iterator and yields the removed items.\n `replace_with` does not need to be the same length as `range`.\n\n `range` is removed even if the `Splice` iterator is not consumed before it is dropped.\n\n It is unspecified how many elements are removed from the vector\n if the `Splice` value is leaked.\n\n The input iterator `replace_with` is only consumed when the `Splice` value is dropped.\n\n This is optimal if:\n\n * The tail (elements in the vector after `range`) is empty,\n * or `replace_with` yields fewer or equal elements than `range`'s length\n * or the lower bound of its `size_hint()` is exact.\n\n Otherwise, a temporary vector is allocated and the tail is moved twice.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the range has `start_bound > end_bound`, or, if the range is\n bounded on either end and past the length of the vector.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n let new = [7, 8, 9];\n let u: Vec<_> = v.splice(1..3, new).collect();\n assert_eq!(v, [1, 7, 8, 9, 4]);\n assert_eq!(u, [2, 3]);\n ```\n\n Using `splice` to insert new items into a vector efficiently at a specific position\n indicated by an empty range:\n\n ```\n let mut v = vec![1, 5];\n let new = [2, 3, 4];\n v.splice(1..1, new);\n assert_eq!(v, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n ```\n"
