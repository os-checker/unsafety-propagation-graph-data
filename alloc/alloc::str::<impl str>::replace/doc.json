  "doc": " Replaces all matches of a pattern with another string.\n\n `replace` creates a new [`String`], and copies the data from this string slice into it.\n While doing so, it attempts to find matches of a pattern. If it finds any, it\n replaces them with the replacement string slice.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let s = \"this is old\";\n\n assert_eq!(\"this is new\", s.replace(\"old\", \"new\"));\n assert_eq!(\"than an old\", s.replace(\"is\", \"an\"));\n ```\n\n When the pattern doesn't match, it returns this string slice as [`String`]:\n\n ```\n let s = \"this is old\";\n assert_eq!(s, s.replace(\"cookie monster\", \"little lamb\"));\n ```\n"
