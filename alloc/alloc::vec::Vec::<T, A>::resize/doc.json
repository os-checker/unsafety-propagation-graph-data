  "doc": " Resizes the `Vec` in-place so that `len` is equal to `new_len`.\n\n If `new_len` is greater than `len`, the `Vec` is extended by the\n difference, with each additional slot filled with `value`.\n If `new_len` is less than `len`, the `Vec` is simply truncated.\n\n This method requires `T` to implement [`Clone`],\n in order to be able to clone the passed value.\n If you need more flexibility (or want to rely on [`Default`] instead of\n [`Clone`]), use [`Vec::resize_with`].\n If you only need to resize to a smaller size, use [`Vec::truncate`].\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` _bytes_.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut vec = vec![\"hello\"];\n vec.resize(3, \"world\");\n assert_eq!(vec, [\"hello\", \"world\", \"world\"]);\n\n let mut vec = vec!['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];\n vec.resize(2, '_');\n assert_eq!(vec, ['a', 'b']);\n ```\n"
