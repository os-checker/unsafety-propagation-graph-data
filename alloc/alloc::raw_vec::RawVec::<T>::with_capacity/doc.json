  "doc": " Creates a `RawVec` (on the system heap) with exactly the\n capacity and alignment requirements for a `[T; capacity]`. This is\n equivalent to calling `RawVec::new` when `capacity` is `0` or `T` is\n zero-sized. Note that if `T` is zero-sized this means you will\n *not* get a `RawVec` with the requested capacity.\n\n Non-fallible version of `try_with_capacity`\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the requested capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` bytes.\n\n # Aborts\n\n Aborts on OOM.\n"
