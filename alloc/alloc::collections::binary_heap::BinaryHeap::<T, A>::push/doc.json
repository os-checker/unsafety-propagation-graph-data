  "doc": " Pushes an item onto the binary heap.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();\n heap.push(3);\n heap.push(5);\n heap.push(1);\n\n assert_eq!(heap.len(), 3);\n assert_eq!(heap.peek(), Some(&5));\n ```\n\n # Time complexity\n\n The expected cost of `push`, averaged over every possible ordering of\n the elements being pushed, and over a sufficiently large number of\n pushes, is *O*(1). This is the most meaningful cost metric when pushing\n elements that are *not* already in any sorted pattern.\n\n The time complexity degrades if elements are pushed in predominantly\n ascending order. In the worst case, elements are pushed in ascending\n sorted order and the amortized cost per push is *O*(log(*n*)) against a heap\n containing *n* elements.\n\n The worst case cost of a *single* call to `push` is *O*(*n*). The worst case\n occurs when capacity is exhausted and needs a resize. The resize cost\n has been amortized in the previous figures.\n"
