  "doc": " Creates an empty `BinaryHeap` with at least the specified capacity.\n\n The binary heap will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without\n reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than\n `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the binary heap will not allocate.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::BinaryHeap;\n let mut heap = BinaryHeap::with_capacity(10);\n heap.push(4);\n ```\n"
