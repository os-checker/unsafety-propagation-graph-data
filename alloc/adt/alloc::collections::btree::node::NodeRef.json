  "doc_adt": "\n A reference to a node.\n\n This type has a number of parameters that control how it acts:\n - `BorrowType`: A dummy type that describes the kind of borrow and carries a lifetime.\n    - When this is `Immut<'a>`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `&'a Node`.\n    - When this is `ValMut<'a>`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `&'a Node`\n      with respect to keys and tree structure, but also allows many\n      mutable references to values throughout the tree to coexist.\n    - When this is `Mut<'a>`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `&'a mut Node`,\n      although insert methods allow a mutable pointer to a value to coexist.\n    - When this is `Owned`, the `NodeRef` acts roughly like `Box<Node>`,\n      but does not have a destructor, and must be cleaned up manually.\n    - When this is `Dying`, the `NodeRef` still acts roughly like `Box<Node>`,\n      but has methods to destroy the tree bit by bit, and ordinary methods,\n      while not marked as unsafe to call, can invoke UB if called incorrectly.\n   Since any `NodeRef` allows navigating through the tree, `BorrowType`\n   effectively applies to the entire tree, not just to the node itself.\n - `K` and `V`: These are the types of keys and values stored in the nodes.\n - `Type`: This can be `Leaf`, `Internal`, or `LeafOrInternal`. When this is\n   `Leaf`, the `NodeRef` points to a leaf node, when this is `Internal` the\n   `NodeRef` points to an internal node, and when this is `LeafOrInternal` the\n   `NodeRef` could be pointing to either type of node.\n   `Type` is named `NodeType` when used outside `NodeRef`.\n\n Both `BorrowType` and `NodeType` restrict what methods we implement, to\n exploit static type safety. There are limitations in the way we can apply\n such restrictions:\n - For each type parameter, we can only define a method either generically\n   or for one particular type. For example, we cannot define a method like\n   `into_kv` generically for all `BorrowType`, or once for all types that\n   carry a lifetime, because we want it to return `&'a` references.\n   Therefore, we define it only for the least powerful type `Immut<'a>`.\n - We cannot get implicit coercion from say `Mut<'a>` to `Immut<'a>`.\n   Therefore, we have to explicitly call `reborrow` on a more powerful\n   `NodeRef` in order to reach a method like `into_kv`.\n\n All methods on `NodeRef` that return some kind of reference, either:\n - Take `self` by value, and return the lifetime carried by `BorrowType`.\n   Sometimes, to invoke such a method, we need to call `reborrow_mut`.\n - Take `self` by reference, and (implicitly) return that reference's\n   lifetime, instead of the lifetime carried by `BorrowType`. That way,\n   the borrow checker guarantees that the `NodeRef` remains borrowed as long\n   as the returned reference is used.\n   The methods supporting insert bend this rule by returning a raw pointer,\n   i.e., a reference without any lifetime.\n",
