  "doc_adt": " `Weak` is a version of [`Arc`] that holds a non-owning reference to the\n managed allocation.\n\n The allocation is accessed by calling [`upgrade`] on the `Weak`\n pointer, which returns an <code>[Option]<[Arc]\\<T>></code>.\n\n Since a `Weak` reference does not count towards ownership, it will not\n prevent the value stored in the allocation from being dropped, and `Weak` itself makes no\n guarantees about the value still being present. Thus it may return [`None`]\n when [`upgrade`]d. Note however that a `Weak` reference *does* prevent the allocation\n itself (the backing store) from being deallocated.\n\n A `Weak` pointer is useful for keeping a temporary reference to the allocation\n managed by [`Arc`] without preventing its inner value from being dropped. It is also used to\n prevent circular references between [`Arc`] pointers, since mutual owning references\n would never allow either [`Arc`] to be dropped. For example, a tree could\n have strong [`Arc`] pointers from parent nodes to children, and `Weak`\n pointers from children back to their parents.\n\n The typical way to obtain a `Weak` pointer is to call [`Arc::downgrade`].\n\n [`upgrade`]: Weak::upgrade\n",
