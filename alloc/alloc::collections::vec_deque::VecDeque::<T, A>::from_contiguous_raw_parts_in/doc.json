  "doc": " Creates a `VecDeque` from a raw allocation, when the initialized\n part of that allocation forms a *contiguous* subslice thereof.\n\n For use by `vec::IntoIter::into_vecdeque`\n\n # Safety\n\n All the usual requirements on the allocated memory like in\n `Vec::from_raw_parts_in`, but takes a *range* of elements that are\n initialized rather than only supporting `0..len`.  Requires that\n `initialized.start` ≤ `initialized.end` ≤ `capacity`.\n"
