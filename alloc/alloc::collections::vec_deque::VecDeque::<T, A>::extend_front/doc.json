  "doc": " Prepends all contents of the iterator to the front of the deque,\n as if [`push_front`][VecDeque::push_front] was called repeatedly with\n the values yielded by the iterator.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(deque_extend_front)]\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let mut deque = VecDeque::from([4, 5, 6]);\n deque.extend_front([3, 2, 1]);\n assert_eq!(deque, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);\n ```\n\n This behaves like [`push_front`][VecDeque::push_front] was called repeatedly:\n\n ```\n use std::collections::VecDeque;\n\n let mut deque = VecDeque::from([4, 5, 6]);\n for v in [3, 2, 1] {\n     deque.push_front(v);\n }\n assert_eq!(deque, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);\n ```\n"
