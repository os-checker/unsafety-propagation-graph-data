  "doc": " An iterator method that reduces the iterator's elements to a single,\n final value, starting from the back.\n\n This is the reverse version of [`Iterator::fold()`]: it takes elements\n starting from the back of the iterator.\n\n `rfold()` takes two arguments: an initial value, and a closure with two\n arguments: an 'accumulator', and an element. The closure returns the value that\n the accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n\n The initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\n call.\n\n After applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `rfold()`\n returns the accumulator.\n\n This operation is sometimes called 'reduce' or 'inject'.\n\n Folding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want\n to produce a single value from it.\n\n Note: `rfold()` combines elements in a *right-associative* fashion. For associative\n operators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative\n operators like `-` the order will affect the final result.\n For a *left-associative* version of `rfold()`, see [`Iterator::fold()`].\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n // the sum of all of the elements of a\n let sum = a.iter()\n            .rfold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);\n\n assert_eq!(sum, 6);\n ```\n\n This example demonstrates the right-associative nature of `rfold()`:\n it builds a string, starting with an initial value\n and continuing with each element from the back until the front:\n\n ```\n let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n let zero = \"0\".to_string();\n\n let result = numbers.iter().rfold(zero, |acc, &x| {\n     format!(\"({x} + {acc})\")\n });\n\n assert_eq!(result, \"(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + 0)))))\");\n ```\n"
