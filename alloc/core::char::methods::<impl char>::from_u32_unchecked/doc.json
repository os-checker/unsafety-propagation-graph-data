  "doc": " Converts a `u32` to a `char`, ignoring validity.\n\n Note that all `char`s are valid [`u32`]s, and can be cast to one with\n `as`:\n\n ```\n let c = '💯';\n let i = c as u32;\n\n assert_eq!(128175, i);\n ```\n\n However, the reverse is not true: not all valid [`u32`]s are valid\n `char`s. `from_u32_unchecked()` will ignore this, and blindly cast to\n `char`, possibly creating an invalid one.\n\n # Safety\n\n This function is unsafe, as it may construct invalid `char` values.\n\n For a safe version of this function, see the [`from_u32`] function.\n\n [`from_u32`]: #method.from_u32\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let c = unsafe { char::from_u32_unchecked(0x2764) };\n\n assert_eq!('❤', c);\n ```\n"
