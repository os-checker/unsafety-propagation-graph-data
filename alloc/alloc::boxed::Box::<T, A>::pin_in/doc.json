  "doc": " Constructs a new `Pin<Box<T, A>>`. If `T` does not implement [`Unpin`], then\n `x` will be pinned in memory and unable to be moved.\n\n Constructing and pinning of the `Box` can also be done in two steps: `Box::pin_in(x, alloc)`\n does the same as <code>[Box::into_pin]\\([Box::new_in]\\(x, alloc))</code>. Consider using\n [`into_pin`](Box::into_pin) if you already have a `Box<T, A>`, or if you want to\n construct a (pinned) `Box` in a different way than with [`Box::new_in`].\n"
