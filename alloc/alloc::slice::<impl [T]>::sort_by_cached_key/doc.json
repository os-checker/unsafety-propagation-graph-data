  "doc": " Sorts the slice in ascending order with a key extraction function, preserving initial order\n of equal elements.\n\n This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and *O*(*m* \\* *n* + *n* \\*\n log(*n*)) worst-case, where the key function is *O*(*m*).\n\n During sorting, the key function is called at most once per element, by using temporary\n storage to remember the results of key evaluation. The order of calls to the key function is\n unspecified and may change in future versions of the standard library.\n\n If the implementation of [`Ord`] for `K` does not implement a [total order], the function\n may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice\n is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.\n\n For simple key functions (e.g., functions that are property accesses or basic operations),\n [`sort_by_key`](slice::sort_by_key) is likely to be faster.\n\n # Current implementation\n\n The current implementation is based on [instruction-parallel-network sort][ipnsort] by Lukas\n Bergdoll, which combines the fast average case of randomized quicksort with the fast worst\n case of heapsort, while achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. And\n *O*(*k* \\* log(*n*)) where *k* is the number of distinct elements in the input. It leverages\n superscalar out-of-order execution capabilities commonly found in CPUs, to efficiently\n perform the operation.\n\n In the worst case, the algorithm allocates temporary storage in a `Vec<(K, usize)>` the\n length of the slice.\n\n # Panics\n\n May panic if the implementation of [`Ord`] for `K` does not implement a [total order], or if\n the [`Ord`] implementation panics.\n\n All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all\n original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior\n mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside\n of a `Drop` or following a `catch_unwind`) will still have access to all the original\n elements. For instance, if the slice belongs to a `Vec`, the `Vec::drop` method will be able\n to dispose of all contained elements.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut v = [4i32, -5, 1, -3, 2, 10];\n\n // Strings are sorted by lexicographical order.\n v.sort_by_cached_key(|k| k.to_string());\n assert_eq!(v, [-3, -5, 1, 10, 2, 4]);\n ```\n\n [ipnsort]: https://github.com/Voultapher/sort-research-rs/tree/main/ipnsort\n [total order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order\n"
