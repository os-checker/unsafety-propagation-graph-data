  "doc": " Returns a raw mutable pointer to the vector's buffer, or a dangling\n raw pointer valid for zero sized reads if the vector didn't allocate.\n\n The caller must ensure that the vector outlives the pointer this\n function returns, or else it will end up dangling.\n Modifying the vector may cause its buffer to be reallocated,\n which would also make any pointers to it invalid.\n\n This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method\n does not materialize a reference to the underlying slice, and thus the returned pointer\n will remain valid when mixed with other calls to [`as_ptr`], [`as_mut_ptr`],\n and [`as_non_null`].\n Note that calling other methods that materialize references to the slice,\n or references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer,\n may still invalidate this pointer.\n See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.\n\n The method also guarantees that, as long as `T` is not zero-sized and the capacity is\n nonzero, the pointer may be passed into [`dealloc`] with a layout of\n `Layout::array::<T>(capacity)` in order to deallocate the backing memory. If this is done,\n be careful not to run the destructor of the `Vec`, as dropping it will result in\n double-frees. Wrapping the `Vec` in a [`ManuallyDrop`] is the typical way to achieve this.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Allocate vector big enough for 4 elements.\n let size = 4;\n let mut x: Vec<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(size);\n let x_ptr = x.as_mut_ptr();\n\n // Initialize elements via raw pointer writes, then set length.\n unsafe {\n     for i in 0..size {\n         *x_ptr.add(i) = i as i32;\n     }\n     x.set_len(size);\n }\n assert_eq!(&*x, &[0, 1, 2, 3]);\n ```\n\n Due to the aliasing guarantee, the following code is legal:\n\n ```rust\n unsafe {\n     let mut v = vec![0];\n     let ptr1 = v.as_mut_ptr();\n     ptr1.write(1);\n     let ptr2 = v.as_mut_ptr();\n     ptr2.write(2);\n     // Notably, the write to `ptr2` did *not* invalidate `ptr1`:\n     ptr1.write(3);\n }\n ```\n\n Deallocating a vector using [`Box`] (which uses [`dealloc`] internally):\n\n ```\n use std::mem::{ManuallyDrop, MaybeUninit};\n\n let mut v = ManuallyDrop::new(vec![0, 1, 2]);\n let ptr = v.as_mut_ptr();\n let capacity = v.capacity();\n let slice_ptr: *mut [MaybeUninit<i32>] =\n     std::ptr::slice_from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.cast(), capacity);\n drop(unsafe { Box::from_raw(slice_ptr) });\n ```\n\n [`as_mut_ptr`]: Vec::as_mut_ptr\n [`as_ptr`]: Vec::as_ptr\n [`as_non_null`]: Vec::as_non_null\n [`dealloc`]: crate::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc\n [`ManuallyDrop`]: core::mem::ManuallyDrop\n"
