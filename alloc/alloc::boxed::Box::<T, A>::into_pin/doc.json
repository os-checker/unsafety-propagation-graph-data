  "doc": " Converts a `Box<T>` into a `Pin<Box<T>>`. If `T` does not implement [`Unpin`], then\n `*boxed` will be pinned in memory and unable to be moved.\n\n This conversion does not allocate on the heap and happens in place.\n\n This is also available via [`From`].\n\n Constructing and pinning a `Box` with <code>Box::into_pin([Box::new]\\(x))</code>\n can also be written more concisely using <code>[Box::pin]\\(x)</code>.\n This `into_pin` method is useful if you already have a `Box<T>`, or you are\n constructing a (pinned) `Box` in a different way than with [`Box::new`].\n\n # Notes\n\n It's not recommended that crates add an impl like `From<Box<T>> for Pin<T>`,\n as it'll introduce an ambiguity when calling `Pin::from`.\n A demonstration of such a poor impl is shown below.\n\n ```compile_fail\n # use std::pin::Pin;\n struct Foo; // A type defined in this crate.\n impl From<Box<()>> for Pin<Foo> {\n     fn from(_: Box<()>) -> Pin<Foo> {\n         Pin::new(Foo)\n     }\n }\n\n let foo = Box::new(());\n let bar = Pin::from(foo);\n ```\n"
