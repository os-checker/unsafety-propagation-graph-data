Beware, as\n this method is very dangerous, doubly so since it might not immediately appear\n dangerous.\n\n Because mutable pointers can roam anywhere around the tree, the returned\n pointer can easily be used to make the original pointer dangling, out of\n bounds, or invalid under stacked borrow rules.\n"
