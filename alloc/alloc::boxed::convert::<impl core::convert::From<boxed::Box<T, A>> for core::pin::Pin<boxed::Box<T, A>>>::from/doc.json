  "doc": " Converts a `Box<T>` into a `Pin<Box<T>>`. If `T` does not implement [`Unpin`], then\n `*boxed` will be pinned in memory and unable to be moved.\n\n This conversion does not allocate on the heap and happens in place.\n\n This is also available via [`Box::into_pin`].\n\n Constructing and pinning a `Box` with <code><Pin<Box\\<T>>>::from([Box::new]\\(x))</code>\n can also be written more concisely using <code>[Box::pin]\\(x)</code>.\n This `From` implementation is useful if you already have a `Box<T>`, or you are\n constructing a (pinned) `Box` in a different way than with [`Box::new`].\n"
