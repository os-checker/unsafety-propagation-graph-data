  "doc": " Appends all key-value pairs from the union of two ascending iterators,\n incrementing a `length` variable along the way. The latter makes it\n easier for the caller to avoid a leak when a drop handler panicks.\n\n If both iterators produce the same key, this method drops the pair from\n the left iterator and appends the pair from the right iterator.\n\n If you want the tree to end up in a strictly ascending order, like for\n a `BTreeMap`, both iterators should produce keys in strictly ascending\n order, each greater than all keys in the tree, including any keys\n already in the tree upon entry.\n"
