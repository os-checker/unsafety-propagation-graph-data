  "doc": " Gets a mutable pointer to the contained value. Reading from this pointer or turning it\n into a reference is undefined behavior unless the `MaybeUninit<T>` is initialized.\n\n # Examples\n\n Correct usage of this method:\n\n ```rust\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<Vec<u32>>::uninit();\n x.write(vec![0, 1, 2]);\n // Create a reference into the `MaybeUninit<Vec<u32>>`.\n // This is okay because we initialized it.\n let x_vec = unsafe { &mut *x.as_mut_ptr() };\n x_vec.push(3);\n assert_eq!(x_vec.len(), 4);\n # // Prevent leaks for Miri\n # unsafe { MaybeUninit::assume_init_drop(&mut x); }\n ```\n\n *Incorrect* usage of this method:\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::mem::MaybeUninit;\n\n let mut x = MaybeUninit::<Vec<u32>>::uninit();\n let x_vec = unsafe { &mut *x.as_mut_ptr() };\n // We have created a reference to an uninitialized vector! This is undefined behavior. ⚠️\n ```\n\n (Notice that the rules around references to uninitialized data are not finalized yet, but\n until they are, it is advisable to avoid them.)\n"
