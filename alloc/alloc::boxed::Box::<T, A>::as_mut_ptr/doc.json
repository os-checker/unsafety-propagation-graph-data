  "doc": " Returns a raw mutable pointer to the `Box`'s contents.\n\n The caller must ensure that the `Box` outlives the pointer this\n function returns, or else it will end up dangling.\n\n This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method\n does not materialize a reference to the underlying memory, and thus the returned pointer\n will remain valid when mixed with other calls to [`as_ptr`] and [`as_mut_ptr`].\n Note that calling other methods that materialize references to the memory\n may still invalidate this pointer.\n See the example below for how this guarantee can be used.\n\n # Examples\n\n Due to the aliasing guarantee, the following code is legal:\n\n ```rust\n #![feature(box_as_ptr)]\n\n unsafe {\n     let mut b = Box::new(0);\n     let ptr1 = Box::as_mut_ptr(&mut b);\n     ptr1.write(1);\n     let ptr2 = Box::as_mut_ptr(&mut b);\n     ptr2.write(2);\n     // Notably, the write to `ptr2` did *not* invalidate `ptr1`:\n     ptr1.write(3);\n }\n ```\n\n [`as_mut_ptr`]: Self::as_mut_ptr\n [`as_ptr`]: Self::as_ptr\n"
