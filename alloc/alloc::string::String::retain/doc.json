  "doc": " Retains only the characters specified by the predicate.\n\n In other words, remove all characters `c` such that `f(c)` returns `false`.\n This method operates in place, visiting each character exactly once in the\n original order, and preserves the order of the retained characters.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut s = String::from(\"f_o_ob_ar\");\n\n s.retain(|c| c != '_');\n\n assert_eq!(s, \"foobar\");\n ```\n\n Because the elements are visited exactly once in the original order,\n external state may be used to decide which elements to keep.\n\n ```\n let mut s = String::from(\"abcde\");\n let keep = [false, true, true, false, true];\n let mut iter = keep.iter();\n s.retain(|_| *iter.next().unwrap());\n assert_eq!(s, \"bce\");\n ```\n"
