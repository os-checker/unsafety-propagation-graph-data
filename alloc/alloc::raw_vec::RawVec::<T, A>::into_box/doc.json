  "doc": " Converts the entire buffer into `Box<[MaybeUninit<T>]>` with the specified `len`.\n\n Note that this will correctly reconstitute any `cap` changes\n that may have been performed. (See description of type for details.)\n\n # Safety\n\n * `len` must be greater than or equal to the most recently requested capacity, and\n * `len` must be less than or equal to `self.capacity()`.\n\n Note, that the requested capacity and `self.capacity()` could differ, as\n an allocator could overallocate and return a greater memory block than requested.\n"
