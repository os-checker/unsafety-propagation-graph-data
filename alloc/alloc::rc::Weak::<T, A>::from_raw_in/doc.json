  "doc": " Converts a raw pointer previously created by [`into_raw`] back into `Weak<T>`.\n\n This can be used to safely get a strong reference (by calling [`upgrade`]\n later) or to deallocate the weak count by dropping the `Weak<T>`.\n\n It takes ownership of one weak reference (with the exception of pointers created by [`new`],\n as these don't own anything; the method still works on them).\n\n # Safety\n\n The pointer must have originated from the [`into_raw`] and must still own its potential\n weak reference, and `ptr` must point to a block of memory allocated by `alloc`.\n\n It is allowed for the strong count to be 0 at the time of calling this. Nevertheless, this\n takes ownership of one weak reference currently represented as a raw pointer (the weak\n count is not modified by this operation) and therefore it must be paired with a previous\n call to [`into_raw`].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};\n\n let strong = Rc::new(\"hello\".to_owned());\n\n let raw_1 = Rc::downgrade(&strong).into_raw();\n let raw_2 = Rc::downgrade(&strong).into_raw();\n\n assert_eq!(2, Rc::weak_count(&strong));\n\n assert_eq!(\"hello\", &*unsafe { Weak::from_raw(raw_1) }.upgrade().unwrap());\n assert_eq!(1, Rc::weak_count(&strong));\n\n drop(strong);\n\n // Decrement the last weak count.\n assert!(unsafe { Weak::from_raw(raw_2) }.upgrade().is_none());\n ```\n\n [`into_raw`]: Weak::into_raw\n [`upgrade`]: Weak::upgrade\n [`new`]: Weak::new\n"
