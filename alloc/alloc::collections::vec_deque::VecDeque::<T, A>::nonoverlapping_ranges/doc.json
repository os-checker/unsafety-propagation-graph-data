  "doc": " Get source, destination and count (like the arguments to [`ptr::copy_nonoverlapping`])\n for copying `count` values from index `src` to index `dst`.\n One of the ranges can wrap around the physical buffer, for this reason 2 triples are returned.\n\n Use of the word \"ranges\" specifically refers to `src..src + count` and `dst..dst + count`.\n\n # Safety\n\n - Ranges must not overlap: `src.abs_diff(dst) >= count`.\n - Ranges must be in bounds of the logical buffer: `src + count <= self.capacity()` and `dst + count <= self.capacity()`.\n - `head` must be in bounds: `head < self.capacity()`.\n"
