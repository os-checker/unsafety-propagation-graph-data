  "doc": " Maps the value in a box, reusing the allocation if possible.\n\n `f` is called on the value in the box, and the result is returned, also boxed.\n\n Note: this is an associated function, which means that you have\n to call it as `Box::map(b, f)` instead of `b.map(f)`. This\n is so that there is no conflict with a method on the inner type.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(smart_pointer_try_map)]\n\n let b = Box::new(7);\n let new = Box::map(b, |i| i + 7);\n assert_eq!(*new, 14);\n ```\n"
