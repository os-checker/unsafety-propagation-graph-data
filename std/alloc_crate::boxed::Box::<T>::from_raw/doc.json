  "doc": " Constructs a box from a raw pointer.\n\n After calling this function, the raw pointer is owned by the\n resulting `Box`. Specifically, the `Box` destructor will call\n the destructor of `T` and free the allocated memory. For this\n to be safe, the memory must have been allocated in accordance\n with the [memory layout] used by `Box` .\n\n # Safety\n\n This function is unsafe because improper use may lead to\n memory problems. For example, a double-free may occur if the\n function is called twice on the same raw pointer.\n\n The raw pointer must point to a block of memory allocated by the global allocator.\n\n The safety conditions are described in the [memory layout] section.\n\n # Examples\n\n Recreate a `Box` which was previously converted to a raw pointer\n using [`Box::into_raw`]:\n ```\n let x = Box::new(5);\n let ptr = Box::into_raw(x);\n let x = unsafe { Box::from_raw(ptr) };\n ```\n Manually create a `Box` from scratch by using the global allocator:\n ```\n use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};\n\n unsafe {\n     let ptr = alloc(Layout::new::<i32>()) as *mut i32;\n     // In general .write is required to avoid attempting to destruct\n     // the (uninitialized) previous contents of `ptr`, though for this\n     // simple example `*ptr = 5` would have worked as well.\n     ptr.write(5);\n     let x = Box::from_raw(ptr);\n }\n ```\n\n [memory layout]: self#memory-layout\n"
