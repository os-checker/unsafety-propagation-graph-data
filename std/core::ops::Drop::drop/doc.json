  "doc": " Executes the destructor for this type.\n\n This method is called implicitly when the value goes out of scope,\n and cannot be called explicitly (this is compiler error [E0040]).\n However, the [`mem::drop`] function in the prelude can be\n used to call the argument's `Drop` implementation.\n\n When this method has been called, `self` has not yet been deallocated.\n That only happens after the method is over.\n If this wasn't the case, `self` would be a dangling reference.\n\n # Panics\n\n Implementations should generally avoid [`panic!`]ing, because `drop()` may itself be called\n during unwinding due to a panic, and if the `drop()` panics in that situation (a “double\n panic”), this will likely abort the program. It is possible to check [`panicking()`] first,\n which may be desirable for a `Drop` implementation that is reporting a bug of the kind\n “you didn't finish using this before it was dropped”; but most types should simply clean up\n their owned allocations or other resources and return normally from `drop()`, regardless of\n what state they are in.\n\n Note that even if this panics, the value is considered to be dropped;\n you must not cause `drop` to be called again. This is normally automatically\n handled by the compiler, but when using unsafe code, can sometimes occur\n unintentionally, particularly when using [`ptr::drop_in_place`].\n\n [E0040]: ../../error_codes/E0040.html\n [`panic!`]: crate::panic!\n [`panicking()`]: ../../std/thread/fn.panicking.html\n [`mem::drop`]: drop\n [`ptr::drop_in_place`]: crate::ptr::drop_in_place\n"
