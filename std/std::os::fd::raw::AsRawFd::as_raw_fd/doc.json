  "doc": " Extracts the raw file descriptor.\n\n This function is typically used to **borrow** an owned file descriptor.\n When used in this way, this method does **not** pass ownership of the\n raw file descriptor to the caller, and the file descriptor is only\n guaranteed to be valid while the original object has not yet been\n destroyed.\n\n However, borrowing is not strictly required. See [`AsFd::as_fd`]\n for an API which strictly borrows a file descriptor.\n\n # Example\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::File;\n # use std::io;\n #[cfg(any(unix, target_os = \"wasi\"))]\n use std::os::fd::{AsRawFd, RawFd};\n\n let mut f = File::open(\"foo.txt\")?;\n // Note that `raw_fd` is only valid as long as `f` exists.\n #[cfg(any(unix, target_os = \"wasi\"))]\n let raw_fd: RawFd = f.as_raw_fd();\n # Ok::<(), io::Error>(())\n ```\n"
