  "doc": " Checks whether the path ends in a trailing [separator](MAIN_SEPARATOR).\n\n This is generally done to ensure that a path is treated as a directory, not a file,\n although it does not actually guarantee that such a path is a directory on the underlying\n file system.\n\n Despite this behavior, two paths are still considered the same in Rust whether they have a\n trailing separator or not.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(path_trailing_sep)]\n use std::path::Path;\n\n assert!(Path::new(\"dir/\").has_trailing_sep());\n assert!(!Path::new(\"file.rs\").has_trailing_sep());\n ```\n"
