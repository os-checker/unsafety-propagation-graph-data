  "doc": " Forcibly captures a full backtrace, regardless of environment variable\n configuration.\n\n This function behaves the same as `capture` except that it ignores the\n values of the `RUST_BACKTRACE` and `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE` environment\n variables, always capturing a backtrace.\n\n Note that capturing a backtrace can be an expensive operation on some\n platforms, so this should be used with caution in performance-sensitive\n parts of code.\n"
