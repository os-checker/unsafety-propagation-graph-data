  "doc": " Provides plumbing to `Vec::extend_from_slice` without giving full\n mutable access to the `Vec`.\n\n # Safety\n\n The slice must be valid for the platform encoding (as described in\n [`OsStr::from_encoded_bytes_unchecked`]).\n\n This bypasses the encoding-dependent surrogate joining, so either\n `self` must not end with a leading surrogate half, or `other` must not\n start with a trailing surrogate half.\n"
