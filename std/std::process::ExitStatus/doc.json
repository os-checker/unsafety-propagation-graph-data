  "doc": " Describes the result of a process after it has terminated.\n\n This `struct` is used to represent the exit status or other termination of a child process.\n Child processes are created via the [`Command`] struct and their exit\n status is exposed through the [`status`] method, or the [`wait`] method\n of a [`Child`] process.\n\n An `ExitStatus` represents every possible disposition of a process.  On Unix this\n is the **wait status**.  It is *not* simply an *exit status* (a value passed to `exit`).\n\n For proper error reporting of failed processes, print the value of `ExitStatus` or\n `ExitStatusError` using their implementations of [`Display`](crate::fmt::Display).\n\n # Differences from `ExitCode`\n\n [`ExitCode`] is intended for terminating the currently running process, via\n the `Termination` trait, in contrast to `ExitStatus`, which represents the\n termination of a child process. These APIs are separate due to platform\n compatibility differences and their expected usage; it is not generally\n possible to exactly reproduce an `ExitStatus` from a child for the current\n process after the fact.\n\n [`status`]: Command::status\n [`wait`]: Child::wait\n"
