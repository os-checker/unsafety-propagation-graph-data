  "doc": " Converts a vector of bytes to a `String`.\n\n A string ([`String`]) is made of bytes ([`u8`]), and a vector of bytes\n ([`Vec<u8>`]) is made of bytes, so this function converts between the\n two. Not all byte slices are valid `String`s, however: `String`\n requires that it is valid UTF-8. `from_utf8()` checks to ensure that\n the bytes are valid UTF-8, and then does the conversion.\n\n If you are sure that the byte slice is valid UTF-8, and you don't want\n to incur the overhead of the validity check, there is an unsafe version\n of this function, [`from_utf8_unchecked`], which has the same behavior\n but skips the check.\n\n This method will take care to not copy the vector, for efficiency's\n sake.\n\n If you need a [`&str`] instead of a `String`, consider\n [`str::from_utf8`].\n\n The inverse of this method is [`into_bytes`].\n\n # Errors\n\n Returns [`Err`] if the slice is not UTF-8 with a description as to why the\n provided bytes are not UTF-8. The vector you moved in is also included.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n // some bytes, in a vector\n let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];\n\n // We know these bytes are valid, so we'll use `unwrap()`.\n let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).unwrap();\n\n assert_eq!(\"💖\", sparkle_heart);\n ```\n\n Incorrect bytes:\n\n ```\n // some invalid bytes, in a vector\n let sparkle_heart = vec![0, 159, 146, 150];\n\n assert!(String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).is_err());\n ```\n\n See the docs for [`FromUtf8Error`] for more details on what you can do\n with this error.\n\n [`from_utf8_unchecked`]: String::from_utf8_unchecked\n [`Vec<u8>`]: crate::vec::Vec \"Vec\"\n [`&str`]: prim@str \"&str\"\n [`into_bytes`]: String::into_bytes\n"
