  "doc": " Attempts to collect the exit status of the child if it has already\n exited.\n\n This function will not block the calling thread and will only\n check to see if the child process has exited or not. If the child has\n exited then on Unix the process ID is reaped. This function is\n guaranteed to repeatedly return a successful exit status so long as the\n child has already exited.\n\n If the child has exited, then `Ok(Some(status))` is returned. If the\n exit status is not available at this time then `Ok(None)` is returned.\n If an error occurs, then that error is returned.\n\n Note that unlike `wait`, this function will not attempt to drop stdin.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process::Command;\n\n let mut child = Command::new(\"ls\").spawn()?;\n\n match child.try_wait() {\n     Ok(Some(status)) => println!(\"exited with: {status}\"),\n     Ok(None) => {\n         println!(\"status not ready yet, let's really wait\");\n         let res = child.wait();\n         println!(\"result: {res:?}\");\n     }\n     Err(e) => println!(\"error attempting to wait: {e}\"),\n }\n # std::io::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n"
