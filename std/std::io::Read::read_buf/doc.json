  "doc": " Pull some bytes from this source into the specified buffer.\n\n This is equivalent to the [`read`](Read::read) method, except that it is passed a [`BorrowedCursor`] rather than `[u8]` to allow use\n with uninitialized buffers. The new data will be appended to any existing contents of `buf`.\n\n The default implementation delegates to `read`.\n\n This method makes it possible to return both data and an error but it is advised against.\n"
