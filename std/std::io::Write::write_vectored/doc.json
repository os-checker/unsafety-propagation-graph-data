  "doc": " Like [`write`], except that it writes from a slice of buffers.\n\n Data is copied from each buffer in order, with the final buffer\n read from possibly being only partially consumed. This method must\n behave as a call to [`write`] with the buffers concatenated would.\n\n The default implementation calls [`write`] with either the first nonempty\n buffer provided, or an empty one if none exists.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::IoSlice;\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::fs::File;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let data1 = [1; 8];\n     let data2 = [15; 8];\n     let io_slice1 = IoSlice::new(&data1);\n     let io_slice2 = IoSlice::new(&data2);\n\n     let mut buffer = File::create(\"foo.txt\")?;\n\n     // Writes some prefix of the byte string, not necessarily all of it.\n     buffer.write_vectored(&[io_slice1, io_slice2])?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n [`write`]: Write::write\n"
