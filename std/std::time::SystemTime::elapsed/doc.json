  "doc": " Returns the difference from this system time to the\n current clock time.\n\n This function may fail as the underlying system clock is susceptible to\n drift and updates (e.g., the system clock could go backwards), so this\n function might not always succeed. If successful, <code>[Ok]\\([Duration])</code> is\n returned where the duration represents the amount of time elapsed from\n this time measurement to the current time.\n\n To measure elapsed time reliably, use [`Instant`] instead.\n\n Returns an [`Err`] if `self` is later than the current system time, and\n the error contains how far from the current system time `self` is.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::thread::sleep;\n use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};\n\n let sys_time = SystemTime::now();\n let one_sec = Duration::from_secs(1);\n sleep(one_sec);\n assert!(sys_time.elapsed().unwrap() >= one_sec);\n ```\n"
