This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let one = 1.0f32;\n // e^1\n let e = one.exp();\n\n // ln(e) - 1 == 0\n let abs_difference = (e.ln() - 1.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= 1e-6);\n ```\n"
