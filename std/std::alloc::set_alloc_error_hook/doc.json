  "doc": " Registers a custom allocation error hook, replacing any that was previously registered.\n\n The allocation error hook is invoked when an infallible memory allocation fails — that is,\n as a consequence of calling [`handle_alloc_error`] — before the runtime aborts.\n\n The allocation error hook is a global resource. [`take_alloc_error_hook`] may be used to\n retrieve a previously registered hook and wrap or discard it.\n\n # What the provided `hook` function should expect\n\n The hook function is provided with a [`Layout`] struct which contains information\n about the allocation that failed.\n\n The hook function may choose to panic or abort; in the event that it returns normally, this\n will cause an immediate abort.\n\n Since [`take_alloc_error_hook`] is a safe function that allows retrieving the hook, the hook\n function must be _sound_ to call even if no memory allocations were attempted.\n\n # The default hook\n\n The default hook, used if [`set_alloc_error_hook`] is never called, prints a message to\n standard error (and then returns, causing the runtime to abort the process).\n Compiler options may cause it to panic instead, and the default behavior may be changed\n to panicking in future versions of Rust.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(alloc_error_hook)]\n\n use std::alloc::{Layout, set_alloc_error_hook};\n\n fn custom_alloc_error_hook(layout: Layout) {\n    panic!(\"memory allocation of {} bytes failed\", layout.size());\n }\n\n set_alloc_error_hook(custom_alloc_error_hook);\n ```\n"
