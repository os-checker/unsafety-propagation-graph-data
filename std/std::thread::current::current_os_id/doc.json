If not, return the Rust\n thread ID.\n\n We use a `u64` to all possible platform IDs without excess `cfg`; most use `int`, some use a\n pointer, and Apple uses `uint64_t`. This is a \"best effort\" approach for diagnostics and is\n allowed to fall back to a non-OS ID (such as the Rust thread ID) or a non-unique ID (such as a\n PID) if the thread ID cannot be retrieved.\n"
