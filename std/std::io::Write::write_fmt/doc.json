  "doc": " Writes a formatted string into this writer, returning any error\n encountered.\n\n This method is primarily used to interface with the\n [`format_args!()`] macro, and it is rare that this should\n explicitly be called. The [`write!()`] macro should be favored to\n invoke this method instead.\n\n This function internally uses the [`write_all`] method on\n this trait and hence will continuously write data so long as no errors\n are received. This also means that partial writes are not indicated in\n this signature.\n\n [`write_all`]: Write::write_all\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return any I/O error reported while formatting.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::fs::File;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let mut buffer = File::create(\"foo.txt\")?;\n\n     // this call\n     write!(buffer, \"{:.*}\", 2, 1.234567)?;\n     // turns into this:\n     buffer.write_fmt(format_args!(\"{:.*}\", 2, 1.234567))?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
