  "doc": " Returns the cube root of a number.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `cbrt` from libc on Unix and\n Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = 8.0_f64;\n\n // x^(1/3) - 2 == 0\n let abs_difference = (x.cbrt() - 2.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference < 1e-10);\n ```\n"
