A pipe is\n typically used to communicate between two or more separate processes, as there are better,\n faster ways to communicate within a single process.\n\n In particular:\n\n * A read on a [`PipeReader`] blocks until the pipe is non-empty.\n * A write on a [`PipeWriter`] blocks when the pipe is full.\n * When all copies of a [`PipeWriter`] are closed, a read on the corresponding [`PipeReader`]\n   returns EOF.\n * [`PipeWriter`] can be shared, and multiple processes or threads can write to it at once, but\n   writes (above a target-specific threshold) may have their data interleaved.\n * [`PipeReader`] can be shared, and multiple processes or threads can read it at once. Any\n   given byte will only get consumed by one reader. There are no guarantees about data\n   interleaving.\n * Portable applications cannot assume any atomicity of messages larger than a single byte.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `pipe` function on Unix and the\n `CreatePipe` function on Windows.\n\n Note that this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n # Capacity\n\n Pipe capacity is platform dependent. To quote the Linux [man page]:\n\n > Different implementations have different limits for the pipe capacity. Applications should\n > not rely on a particular capacity: an application should be designed so that a reading process\n > consumes data as soon as it is available, so that a writing process does not remain blocked.\n\n # Example\n\n ```no_run\n # #[cfg(miri)] fn main() {}\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n use std::io::{Read, Write, pipe};\n use std::process::Command;\n let (ping_reader, mut ping_writer) = pipe()?;\n let (mut pong_reader, pong_writer) = pipe()?;\n\n // Spawn a child process that echoes its input.\n let mut echo_command = Command::new(\"cat\");\n echo_command.stdin(ping_reader);\n echo_command.stdout(pong_writer);\n let mut echo_child = echo_command.spawn()?;\n\n // Send input to the child process. Note that because we're writing all the input before we\n // read any output, this could deadlock if the child's input and output pipe buffers both\n // filled up. Those buffers are usually at least a few KB, so \"hello\" is fine, but for longer\n // inputs we'd need to read and write at the same time, e.g. using threads.\n ping_writer.write_all(b\"hello\")?;\n\n // `cat` exits when it reads EOF from stdin, but that can't happen while any ping writer\n // remains open. We need to drop our ping writer, or read_to_string will deadlock below.\n drop(ping_writer);\n\n // The pong reader can't report EOF while any pong writer remains open. Our Command object is\n // holding a pong writer, and again read_to_string will deadlock if we don't drop it.\n drop(echo_command);\n\n let mut buf = String::new();\n // Block until `cat` closes its stdout (a pong writer).\n pong_reader.read_to_string(&mut buf)?;\n assert_eq!(&buf, \"hello\");\n\n // At this point we know `cat` has exited, but we still need to wait to clean up the \"zombie\".\n echo_child.wait()?;\n # Ok(())\n # }\n ```\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n [man page]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html\n"
