  "doc": " Seek to an offset, in bytes, in the underlying reader.\n\n The position used for seeking with <code>[SeekFrom::Current]\\(_)</code> is the\n position the underlying reader would be at if the `BufReader<R>` had no\n internal buffer.\n\n Seeking always discards the internal buffer, even if the seek position\n would otherwise fall within it. This guarantees that calling\n [`BufReader::into_inner()`] immediately after a seek yields the underlying reader\n at the same position.\n\n To seek without discarding the internal buffer, use [`BufReader::seek_relative`].\n\n See [`std::io::Seek`] for more details.\n\n Note: In the edge case where you're seeking with <code>[SeekFrom::Current]\\(n)</code>\n where `n` minus the internal buffer length overflows an `i64`, two\n seeks will be performed instead of one. If the second seek returns\n [`Err`], the underlying reader will be left at the same position it would\n have if you called `seek` with <code>[SeekFrom::Current]\\(0)</code>.\n\n [`std::io::Seek`]: Seek\n"
