  "doc": " Visits the values representing the intersection,\n i.e., the values that are both in `self` and `other`.\n\n When an equal element is present in `self` and `other`\n then the resulting `Intersection` may yield references to\n one or the other. This can be relevant if `T` contains fields which\n are not compared by its `Eq` implementation, and may hold different\n value between the two equal copies of `T` in the two sets.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashSet;\n let a = HashSet::from([1, 2, 3]);\n let b = HashSet::from([4, 2, 3, 4]);\n\n // Print 2, 3 in arbitrary order.\n for x in a.intersection(&b) {\n     println!(\"{x}\");\n }\n\n let intersection: HashSet<_> = a.intersection(&b).collect();\n assert_eq!(intersection, [2, 3].iter().collect());\n ```\n"
