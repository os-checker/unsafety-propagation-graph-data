  "doc": " Creates a new hard link on the filesystem.\n\n The `link` path will be a link pointing to the `original` path. Note that\n systems often require these two paths to both be located on the same\n filesystem.\n\n If `original` names a symbolic link, it is platform-specific whether the\n symbolic link is followed. On platforms where it's possible to not follow\n it, it is not followed, and the created hard link points to the symbolic\n link itself.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds the `CreateHardLink` function on Windows.\n On most Unix systems, it corresponds to the `linkat` function with no flags.\n On Android, VxWorks, and Redox, it instead corresponds to the `link` function.\n On MacOS, it uses the `linkat` function if it is available, but on very old\n systems where `linkat` is not available, `link` is selected at runtime instead.\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not\n limited to just these cases:\n\n * The `original` path is not a file or doesn't exist.\n * The 'link' path already exists.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::hard_link(\"a.txt\", \"b.txt\")?; // Hard link a.txt to b.txt\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
