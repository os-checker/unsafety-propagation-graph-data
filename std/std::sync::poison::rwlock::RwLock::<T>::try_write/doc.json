  "doc": " Attempts to lock this `RwLock` with exclusive write access.\n\n If the lock could not be acquired at this time, then `Err` is returned.\n Otherwise, an RAII guard is returned which will release the lock when\n it is dropped.\n\n This function does not block.\n\n This function does not provide any guarantees with respect to the ordering\n of whether contentious readers or writers will acquire the lock first.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return the [`Poisoned`] error if the `RwLock` is\n poisoned. An `RwLock` is poisoned whenever a writer panics while holding\n an exclusive lock. `Poisoned` will only be returned if the lock would\n have otherwise been acquired. An acquired lock guard will be contained\n in the returned error.\n\n This function will return the [`WouldBlock`] error if the `RwLock` could\n not be acquired because it was already locked.\n\n [`Poisoned`]: TryLockError::Poisoned\n [`WouldBlock`]: TryLockError::WouldBlock\n\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::RwLock;\n\n let lock = RwLock::new(1);\n\n let n = lock.read().unwrap();\n assert_eq!(*n, 1);\n\n assert!(lock.try_write().is_err());\n ```\n"
