Through a [`DirEntry`]\n information like the entry's path and possibly other metadata can be\n learned.\n\n The order in which this iterator returns entries is platform and filesystem\n dependent.\n\n # Errors\n This [`io::Result`] will be an [`Err`] if an error occurred while fetching\n the next entry from the OS.\n"
