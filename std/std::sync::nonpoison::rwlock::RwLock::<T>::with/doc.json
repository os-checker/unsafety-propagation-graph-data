The lock is released after\n the closure completes, even if it panics.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(lock_value_accessors, nonpoison_rwlock)]\n\n use std::sync::nonpoison::RwLock;\n\n let rwlock = RwLock::new(2);\n let result = rwlock.with(|data| *data + 3);\n\n assert_eq!(result, 5);\n ```\n"
