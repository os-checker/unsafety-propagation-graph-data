On success, returns the number of bytes read.\n\n The function must be called with valid byte array `buf` of sufficient size to\n hold the message bytes. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer,\n excess bytes may be discarded.\n\n [`UdpSocket::connect`] will connect this socket to a remote address. This\n method will fail if the socket is not connected.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::UdpSocket;\n\n let socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").expect(\"couldn't bind to address\");\n socket.connect(\"127.0.0.1:8080\").expect(\"connect function failed\");\n let mut buf = [0; 10];\n match socket.recv(&mut buf) {\n     Ok(received) => println!(\"received {received} bytes {:?}\", &buf[..received]),\n     Err(e) => println!(\"recv function failed: {e:?}\"),\n }\n ```\n"
