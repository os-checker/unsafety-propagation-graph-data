Any\n non-utf8 data is lossily converted using the utf8 replacement\n character.\n\n The default format approximates a shell invocation of the program along with its\n arguments. It does not include most of the other command properties. The output is not guaranteed to work\n (e.g. due to lack of shell-escaping or differences in path resolution).\n On some platforms you can use [the alternate syntax] to show more fields.\n\n Note that the debug implementation is platform-specific.\n\n [the alternate syntax]: fmt#sign0\n"
