  "doc": " Normalize a path, including `..` without traversing the filesystem.\n\n Returns an error if normalization would leave leading `..` components.\n\n <div class=\"warning\">\n\n This function always resolves `..` to the \"lexical\" parent.\n That is \"a/b/../c\" will always resolve to `a/c` which can change the meaning of the path.\n In particular, `a/c` and `a/b/../c` are distinct on many systems because `b` may be a symbolic link, so its parent isn't `a`.\n\n </div>\n\n [`path::absolute`](absolute) is an alternative that preserves `..`.\n Or [`Path::canonicalize`] can be used to resolve any `..` by querying the filesystem.\n"
