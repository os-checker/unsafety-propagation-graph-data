Some of these error conditions are listed here, together\n with their [`io::ErrorKind`]. The mapping to [`io::ErrorKind`]s is not\n part of the compatibility contract of the function.\n\n * [`NotFound`]: The specified file does not exist and neither `create`\n   or `create_new` is set.\n * [`NotFound`]: One of the directory components of the file path does\n   not exist.\n * [`PermissionDenied`]: The user lacks permission to get the specified\n   access rights for the file.\n * [`PermissionDenied`]: The user lacks permission to open one of the\n   directory components of the specified path.\n * [`AlreadyExists`]: `create_new` was specified and the file already\n   exists.\n * [`InvalidInput`]: Invalid combinations of open options (truncate\n   without write access, create without write or append access,\n   no access mode set, etc.).\n\n The following errors don't match any existing [`io::ErrorKind`] at the moment:\n * One of the directory components of the specified file path\n   was not, in fact, a directory.\n * Filesystem-level errors: full disk, write permission\n   requested on a read-only file system, exceeded disk quota, too many\n   open files, too long filename, too many symbolic links in the\n   specified path (Unix-like systems only), etc.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::OpenOptions;\n\n let file = OpenOptions::new().read(true).open(\"foo.txt\");\n ```\n\n [`AlreadyExists`]: io::ErrorKind::AlreadyExists\n [`InvalidInput`]: io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput\n [`NotFound`]: io::ErrorKind::NotFound\n [`PermissionDenied`]: io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied\n"
