  "doc": " Hyperbolic tangent function.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `tanhf128` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f128_math)] {\n\n let e = std::f128::consts::E;\n let x = 1.0f128;\n\n let f = x.tanh();\n // Solving tanh() at 1 gives `(1 - e^(-2))/(1 + e^(-2))`\n let g = (1.0 - e.powi(-2)) / (1.0 + e.powi(-2));\n let abs_difference = (f - g).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
