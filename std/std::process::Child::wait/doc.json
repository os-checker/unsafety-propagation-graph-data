  "doc": " Waits for the child to exit completely, returning the status that it\n exited with. This function will continue to have the same return value\n after it has been called at least once.\n\n The stdin handle to the child process, if any, will be closed\n before waiting. This helps avoid deadlock: it ensures that the\n child does not block waiting for input from the parent, while\n the parent waits for the child to exit.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process::Command;\n\n let mut command = Command::new(\"ls\");\n if let Ok(mut child) = command.spawn() {\n     child.wait().expect(\"command wasn't running\");\n     println!(\"Child has finished its execution!\");\n } else {\n     println!(\"ls command didn't start\");\n }\n ```\n"
