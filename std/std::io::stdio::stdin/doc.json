  "doc": " Constructs a new handle to the standard input of the current process.\n\n Each handle returned is a reference to a shared global buffer whose access\n is synchronized via a mutex. If you need more explicit control over\n locking, see the [`Stdin::lock`] method.\n\n ### Note: Windows Portability Considerations\n\n When operating in a console, the Windows implementation of this stream does not support\n non-UTF-8 byte sequences. Attempting to read bytes that are not valid UTF-8 will return\n an error.\n\n In a process with a detached console, such as one using\n `#![windows_subsystem = \"windows\"]`, or in a child process spawned from such a process,\n the contained handle will be null. In such cases, the standard library's `Read` and\n `Write` will do nothing and silently succeed. All other I/O operations, via the\n standard library or via raw Windows API calls, will fail.\n\n # Examples\n\n Using implicit synchronization:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io;\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut buffer = String::new();\n     io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer)?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n Using explicit synchronization:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::{self, BufRead};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut buffer = String::new();\n     let stdin = io::stdin();\n     let mut handle = stdin.lock();\n\n     handle.read_line(&mut buffer)?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
