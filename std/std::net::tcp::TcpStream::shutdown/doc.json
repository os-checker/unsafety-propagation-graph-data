On Linux, the second call will\n return `Ok(())`, but on macOS, it will return `ErrorKind::NotConnected`.\n This may change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::{Shutdown, TcpStream};\n\n let stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")\n                        .expect(\"Couldn't connect to the server...\");\n stream.shutdown(Shutdown::Both).expect(\"shutdown call failed\");\n ```\n"
