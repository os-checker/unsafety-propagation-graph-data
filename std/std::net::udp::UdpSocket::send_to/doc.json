  "doc": " Sends data on the socket to the given address. On success, returns the\n number of bytes written. Note that the operating system may refuse\n buffers larger than 65507. However, partial writes are not possible\n until buffer sizes above `i32::MAX`.\n\n Address type can be any implementor of [`ToSocketAddrs`] trait. See its\n documentation for concrete examples.\n\n It is possible for `addr` to yield multiple addresses, but `send_to`\n will only send data to the first address yielded by `addr`.\n\n This will return an error when the IP version of the local socket\n does not match that returned from [`ToSocketAddrs`].\n\n See [Issue #34202] for more details.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::UdpSocket;\n\n let socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").expect(\"couldn't bind to address\");\n socket.send_to(&[0; 10], \"127.0.0.1:4242\").expect(\"couldn't send data\");\n ```\n\n [Issue #34202]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34202\n"
