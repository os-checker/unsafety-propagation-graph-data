  "doc": " Returns the length of this `OsStr`.\n\n Note that this does **not** return the number of bytes in the string in\n OS string form.\n\n The length returned is that of the underlying storage used by `OsStr`.\n As discussed in the [`OsString`] introduction, [`OsString`] and `OsStr`\n store strings in a form best suited for cheap inter-conversion between\n native-platform and Rust string forms, which may differ significantly\n from both of them, including in storage size and encoding.\n\n This number is simply useful for passing to other methods, like\n [`OsString::with_capacity`] to avoid reallocations.\n\n See the main `OsString` documentation information about encoding and capacity units.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::ffi::OsStr;\n\n let os_str = OsStr::new(\"\");\n assert_eq!(os_str.len(), 0);\n\n let os_str = OsStr::new(\"foo\");\n assert_eq!(os_str.len(), 3);\n ```\n"
