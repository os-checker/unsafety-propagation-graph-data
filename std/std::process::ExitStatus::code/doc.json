  "doc": " Returns the exit code of the process, if any.\n\n In Unix terms the return value is the **exit status**: the value passed to `exit`, if the\n process finished by calling `exit`.  Note that on Unix the exit status is truncated to 8\n bits, and that values that didn't come from a program's call to `exit` may be invented by the\n runtime system (often, for example, 255, 254, 127 or 126).\n\n On Unix, this will return `None` if the process was terminated by a signal.\n [`ExitStatusExt`](crate::os::unix::process::ExitStatusExt) is an\n extension trait for extracting any such signal, and other details, from the `ExitStatus`.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process::Command;\n\n let status = Command::new(\"mkdir\")\n     .arg(\"projects\")\n     .status()\n     .expect(\"failed to execute mkdir\");\n\n match status.code() {\n     Some(code) => println!(\"Exited with status code: {code}\"),\n     None => println!(\"Process terminated by signal\")\n }\n ```\n"
