  "doc": " The positive difference of two numbers.\n\n * If `self <= other`: `0.0`\n * Else: `self - other`\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `fdimf` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = 3.0f32;\n let y = -3.0f32;\n\n let abs_difference_x = (x.abs_sub(1.0) - 2.0).abs();\n let abs_difference_y = (y.abs_sub(1.0) - 0.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference_x <= 1e-6);\n assert!(abs_difference_y <= 1e-6);\n ```\n"
