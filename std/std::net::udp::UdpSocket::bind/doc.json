  "doc": " Creates a UDP socket from the given address.\n\n The address type can be any implementor of [`ToSocketAddrs`] trait. See\n its documentation for concrete examples.\n\n If `addr` yields multiple addresses, `bind` will be attempted with\n each of the addresses until one succeeds and returns the socket. If none\n of the addresses succeed in creating a socket, the error returned from\n the last attempt (the last address) is returned.\n\n # Examples\n\n Creates a UDP socket bound to `127.0.0.1:3400`:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::UdpSocket;\n\n let socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:3400\").expect(\"couldn't bind to address\");\n ```\n\n Creates a UDP socket bound to `127.0.0.1:3400`. If the socket cannot be\n bound to that address, create a UDP socket bound to `127.0.0.1:3401`:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::{SocketAddr, UdpSocket};\n\n let addrs = [\n     SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3400)),\n     SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3401)),\n ];\n let socket = UdpSocket::bind(&addrs[..]).expect(\"couldn't bind to address\");\n ```\n\n Creates a UDP socket bound to a port assigned by the operating system\n at `127.0.0.1`.\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::UdpSocket;\n\n let socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:0\").unwrap();\n ```\n\n Note that `bind` declares the scope of your network connection.\n You can only receive datagrams from and send datagrams to\n participants in that view of the network.\n For instance, binding to a loopback address as in the example\n above will prevent you from sending datagrams to another device\n in your local network.\n\n In order to limit your view of the network the least, `bind` to\n [`Ipv4Addr::UNSPECIFIED`] or [`Ipv6Addr::UNSPECIFIED`].\n"
