  "doc": " Locks this `RwLock` with shared read access, blocking the current thread\n until it can be acquired.\n\n The calling thread will be blocked until there are no more writers which\n hold the lock. There may be other readers currently inside the lock when\n this method returns. This method does not provide any guarantees with\n respect to the ordering of whether contentious readers or writers will\n acquire the lock first.\n\n Returns an RAII guard which will release this thread's shared access\n once it is dropped.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function might panic when called if the lock is already held by the current thread.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(nonpoison_rwlock)]\n\n use std::sync::Arc;\n use std::sync::nonpoison::RwLock;\n use std::thread;\n\n let lock = Arc::new(RwLock::new(1));\n let c_lock = Arc::clone(&lock);\n\n let n = lock.read();\n assert_eq!(*n, 1);\n\n thread::spawn(move || {\n     let r = c_lock.read();\n }).join().unwrap();\n ```\n"
