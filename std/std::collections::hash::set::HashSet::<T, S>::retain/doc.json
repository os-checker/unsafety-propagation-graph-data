  "doc": " Retains only the elements specified by the predicate.\n\n In other words, remove all elements `e` for which `f(&e)` returns `false`.\n The elements are visited in unsorted (and unspecified) order.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashSet;\n\n let mut set = HashSet::from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);\n set.retain(|&k| k % 2 == 0);\n assert_eq!(set, HashSet::from([2, 4, 6]));\n ```\n\n # Performance\n\n In the current implementation, this operation takes O(capacity) time\n instead of O(len) because it internally visits empty buckets too.\n"
