  "doc": " Attempts to send a message into the channel without blocking.\n\n This method will either send a message into the channel immediately or return an error if\n the channel is full or disconnected. The returned error contains the original message.\n\n If called on a zero-capacity channel, this method will send the message only if there\n happens to be a receive operation on the other side of the channel at the same time.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```rust\n #![feature(mpmc_channel)]\n\n use std::sync::mpmc::{channel, Receiver, Sender};\n\n let (sender, _receiver): (Sender<i32>, Receiver<i32>) = channel();\n\n assert!(sender.try_send(1).is_ok());\n ```\n"
