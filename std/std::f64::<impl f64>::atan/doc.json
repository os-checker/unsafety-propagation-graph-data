  "doc": " Computes the arctangent of a number. Return value is in radians in the\n range [-pi/2, pi/2];\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `atan` from libc on Unix and\n Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let f = 1.0_f64;\n\n // atan(tan(1))\n let abs_difference = (f.tan().atan() - 1.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference < 1e-10);\n ```\n"
