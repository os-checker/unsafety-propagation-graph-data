  "doc": " Makes a [`MappedRwLockReadGuard`] for a component of the borrowed data. The\n original guard is returned as an `Err(...)` if the closure returns\n `None`.\n\n The `RwLock` is already locked for reading, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RwLockReadGuard::filter_map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods\n of the same name on the contents of the `RwLockReadGuard` used through\n `Deref`.\n\n # Panics\n\n If the closure panics, the guard will be dropped (unlocked) and the RwLock will not be\n poisoned.\n"
