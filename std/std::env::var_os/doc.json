  "doc": " Fetches the environment variable `key` from the current process, returning\n [`None`] if the variable isn't set or if there is another error.\n\n It may return `None` if the environment variable's name contains\n the equal sign character (`=`) or the NUL character.\n\n Note that this function will not check if the environment variable\n is valid Unicode. If you want to have an error on invalid UTF-8,\n use the [`var`] function instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::env;\n\n let key = \"HOME\";\n match env::var_os(key) {\n     Some(val) => println!(\"{key}: {val:?}\"),\n     None => println!(\"{key} is not defined in the environment.\")\n }\n ```\n\n If expecting a delimited variable (such as `PATH`), [`split_paths`]\n can be used to separate items.\n"
