  "doc": " Writes some vectored data into this BufReader with line buffering.\n\n This means that, if any newlines are present in the data, the data up to\n and including the buffer containing the last newline is sent directly to\n the inner writer, and the data after it is buffered. Returns the number\n of bytes written.\n\n This function operates on a \"best effort basis\"; in keeping with the\n convention of `Write::write`, it makes at most one attempt to write\n new data to the underlying writer.\n\n Because this function attempts to send completed lines to the underlying\n writer, it will also flush the existing buffer if it contains any\n newlines.\n\n Because sorting through an array of `IoSlice` can be a bit convoluted,\n This method differs from write in the following ways:\n\n - It attempts to write the full content of all the buffers up to and\n   including the one containing the last newline. This means that it\n   may attempt to write a partial line, that buffer has data past the\n   newline.\n - If the write only reports partial success, it does not attempt to\n   find the precise location of the written bytes and buffer the rest.\n\n If the underlying vector doesn't support vectored writing, we instead\n simply write the first non-empty buffer with `write`. This way, we\n get the benefits of more granular partial-line handling without losing\n anything in efficiency\n"
