  "doc": " Checks whether the standard library's panic hook will capture and print a\n backtrace.\n\n This function will, if a backtrace style has not been set via\n [`set_backtrace_style`], read the environment variable `RUST_BACKTRACE` to\n determine a default value for the backtrace formatting:\n\n The first call to `get_backtrace_style` may read the `RUST_BACKTRACE`\n environment variable if `set_backtrace_style` has not been called to\n override the default value. After a call to `set_backtrace_style` or\n `get_backtrace_style`, any changes to `RUST_BACKTRACE` will have no effect.\n\n `RUST_BACKTRACE` is read according to these rules:\n\n * `0` for `BacktraceStyle::Off`\n * `full` for `BacktraceStyle::Full`\n * `1` for `BacktraceStyle::Short`\n * Other values are currently `BacktraceStyle::Short`, but this may change in\n   the future\n\n Returns `None` if backtraces aren't currently supported.\n"
