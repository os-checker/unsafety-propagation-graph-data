If `SO_LINGER` is set, the socket will remain open\n for the specified duration as the system attempts to send pending data.\n Otherwise, the system may close the socket immediately, or wait for a\n default timeout.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n #![feature(tcp_linger)]\n\n use std::net::TcpStream;\n use std::time::Duration;\n\n let stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")\n                        .expect(\"Couldn't connect to the server...\");\n stream.set_linger(Some(Duration::from_secs(0))).expect(\"set_linger call failed\");\n ```\n"
