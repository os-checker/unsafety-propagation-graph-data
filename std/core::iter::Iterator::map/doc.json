  "doc": " Takes a closure and creates an iterator which calls that closure on each\n element.\n\n `map()` transforms one iterator into another, by means of its argument:\n something that implements [`FnMut`]. It produces a new iterator which\n calls this closure on each element of the original iterator.\n\n If you are good at thinking in types, you can think of `map()` like this:\n If you have an iterator that gives you elements of some type `A`, and\n you want an iterator of some other type `B`, you can use `map()`,\n passing a closure that takes an `A` and returns a `B`.\n\n `map()` is conceptually similar to a [`for`] loop. However, as `map()` is\n lazy, it is best used when you're already working with other iterators.\n If you're doing some sort of looping for a side effect, it's considered\n more idiomatic to use [`for`] than `map()`.\n\n [`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.iter().map(|x| 2 * x);\n\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(4));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(6));\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n ```\n\n If you're doing some sort of side effect, prefer [`for`] to `map()`:\n\n ```\n # #![allow(unused_must_use)]\n // don't do this:\n (0..5).map(|x| println!(\"{x}\"));\n\n // it won't even execute, as it is lazy. Rust will warn you about this.\n\n // Instead, use a for-loop:\n for x in 0..5 {\n     println!(\"{x}\");\n }\n ```\n"
