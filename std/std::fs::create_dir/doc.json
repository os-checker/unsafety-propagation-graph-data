  "doc": " Creates a new, empty directory at the provided path.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `mkdir` function on Unix\n and the `CreateDirectoryW` function on Windows.\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n **NOTE**: If a parent of the given path doesn't exist, this function will\n return an error. To create a directory and all its missing parents at the\n same time, use the [`create_dir_all`] function.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not\n limited to just these cases:\n\n * User lacks permissions to create directory at `path`.\n * A parent of the given path doesn't exist. (To create a directory and all\n   its missing parents at the same time, use the [`create_dir_all`]\n   function.)\n * `path` already exists.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::create_dir(\"/some/dir\")?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
