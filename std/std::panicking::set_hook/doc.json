  "doc": " Registers a custom panic hook, replacing the previously registered hook.\n\n The panic hook is invoked when a thread panics, but before the panic runtime\n is invoked. As such, the hook will run with both the aborting and unwinding\n runtimes.\n\n The default hook, which is registered at startup, prints a message to standard error and\n generates a backtrace if requested. This behavior can be customized using the `set_hook` function.\n The current hook can be retrieved while reinstating the default hook with the [`take_hook`]\n function.\n\n [`take_hook`]: ./fn.take_hook.html\n\n The hook is provided with a `PanicHookInfo` struct which contains information\n about the origin of the panic, including the payload passed to `panic!` and\n the source code location from which the panic originated.\n\n The panic hook is a global resource.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if called from a panicking thread.\n\n # Examples\n\n The following will print \"Custom panic hook\":\n\n ```should_panic\n use std::panic;\n\n panic::set_hook(Box::new(|_| {\n     println!(\"Custom panic hook\");\n }));\n\n panic!(\"Normal panic\");\n ```\n"
