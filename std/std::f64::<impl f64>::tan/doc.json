  "doc": " Computes the tangent of a number (in radians).\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `tan` from libc on Unix and\n Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = std::f64::consts::FRAC_PI_4;\n let abs_difference = (x.tan() - 1.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference < 1e-14);\n ```\n"
