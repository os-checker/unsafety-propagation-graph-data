  "doc": " Sends a value on this synchronous channel.\n\n This function will *block* until space in the internal buffer becomes\n available or a receiver is available to hand off the message to.\n\n Note that a successful send does *not* guarantee that the receiver will\n ever see the data if there is a buffer on this channel. Items may be\n enqueued in the internal buffer for the receiver to receive at a later\n time. If the buffer size is 0, however, the channel becomes a rendezvous\n channel and it guarantees that the receiver has indeed received\n the data if this function returns success.\n\n This function will never panic, but it may return [`Err`] if the\n [`Receiver`] has disconnected and is no longer able to receive\n information.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```rust\n use std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;\n use std::thread;\n\n // Create a rendezvous sync_channel with buffer size 0\n let (sync_sender, receiver) = sync_channel(0);\n\n thread::spawn(move || {\n    println!(\"sending message...\");\n    sync_sender.send(1).unwrap();\n    // Thread is now blocked until the message is received\n\n    println!(\"...message received!\");\n });\n\n let msg = receiver.recv().unwrap();\n assert_eq!(1, msg);\n ```\n"
