  "doc": " Returns the contents of the internal buffer, filling it with more data, via `Read` methods, if empty.\n\n This is a lower-level method and is meant to be used together with [`consume`],\n which can be used to mark bytes that should not be returned by subsequent calls to `read`.\n\n [`consume`]: BufRead::consume\n\n Returns an empty buffer when the stream has reached EOF.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an I/O error if a `Read` method was called, but returned an error.\n\n # Examples\n\n A locked standard input implements `BufRead`:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io;\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n\n let stdin = io::stdin();\n let mut stdin = stdin.lock();\n\n let buffer = stdin.fill_buf()?;\n\n // work with buffer\n println!(\"{buffer:?}\");\n\n // mark the bytes we worked with as read\n let length = buffer.len();\n stdin.consume(length);\n # std::io::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n"
