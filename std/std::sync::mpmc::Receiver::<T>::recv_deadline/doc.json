  "doc": " Attempts to wait for a value on this receiver, returning an error if the\n corresponding channel has hung up, or if `deadline` is reached.\n\n This function will always block the current thread if there is no data\n available and it's possible for more data to be sent. Once a message is\n sent to the corresponding [`Sender`], then this receiver will wake up\n and return that message.\n\n If the corresponding [`Sender`] has disconnected, or it disconnects while\n this call is blocking, this call will wake up and return [`Err`] to\n indicate that no more messages can ever be received on this channel.\n However, since channels are buffered, messages sent before the disconnect\n will still be properly received.\n\n # Examples\n\n Successfully receiving value before reaching deadline:\n\n ```no_run\n #![feature(mpmc_channel)]\n\n use std::thread;\n use std::time::{Duration, Instant};\n use std::sync::mpmc;\n\n let (send, recv) = mpmc::channel();\n\n thread::spawn(move || {\n     send.send('a').unwrap();\n });\n\n assert_eq!(\n     recv.recv_deadline(Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(400)),\n     Ok('a')\n );\n ```\n\n Receiving an error upon reaching deadline:\n\n ```no_run\n #![feature(mpmc_channel)]\n\n use std::thread;\n use std::time::{Duration, Instant};\n use std::sync::mpmc;\n\n let (send, recv) = mpmc::channel();\n\n thread::spawn(move || {\n     thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(800));\n     send.send('a').unwrap();\n });\n\n assert_eq!(\n     recv.recv_deadline(Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(400)),\n     Err(mpmc::RecvTimeoutError::Timeout)\n );\n ```\n"
