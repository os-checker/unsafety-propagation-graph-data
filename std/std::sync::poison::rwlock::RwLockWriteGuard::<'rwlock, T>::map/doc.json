  "doc": " Makes a [`MappedRwLockWriteGuard`] for a component of the borrowed data, e.g.\n an enum variant.\n\n The `RwLock` is already locked for writing, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `RwLockWriteGuard::map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of\n the same name on the contents of the `RwLockWriteGuard` used through\n `Deref`.\n\n # Panics\n\n If the closure panics, the guard will be dropped (unlocked) and the RwLock will be poisoned.\n"
