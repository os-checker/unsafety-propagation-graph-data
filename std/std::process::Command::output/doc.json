Stdin is not inherited from the parent and any\n attempt by the child process to read from the stdin stream will result\n in the stream immediately closing.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```should_panic\n use std::process::Command;\n use std::io::{self, Write};\n let output = Command::new(\"/bin/cat\")\n     .arg(\"file.txt\")\n     .output()?;\n\n println!(\"status: {}\", output.status);\n io::stdout().write_all(&output.stdout)?;\n io::stderr().write_all(&output.stderr)?;\n\n assert!(output.status.success());\n # io::Result::Ok(())\n ```\n"
