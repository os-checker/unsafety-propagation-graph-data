  "doc": " Returns an iterator over the entries within a directory.\n\n The iterator will yield instances of <code>[io::Result]<[DirEntry]></code>.\n New errors may be encountered after an iterator is initially constructed.\n Entries for the current and parent directories (typically `.` and `..`) are\n skipped.\n\n The order in which `read_dir` returns entries can change between calls. If reproducible\n ordering is required, the entries should be explicitly sorted.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `opendir` function on Unix\n and the `FindFirstFileEx` function on Windows. Advancing the iterator\n currently corresponds to `readdir` on Unix and `FindNextFile` on Windows.\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n The order in which this iterator returns entries is platform and filesystem\n dependent.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not\n limited to just these cases:\n\n * The provided `path` doesn't exist.\n * The process lacks permissions to view the contents.\n * The `path` points at a non-directory file.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::io;\n use std::fs::{self, DirEntry};\n use std::path::Path;\n\n // one possible implementation of walking a directory only visiting files\n fn visit_dirs(dir: &Path, cb: &dyn Fn(&DirEntry)) -> io::Result<()> {\n     if dir.is_dir() {\n         for entry in fs::read_dir(dir)? {\n             let entry = entry?;\n             let path = entry.path();\n             if path.is_dir() {\n                 visit_dirs(&path, cb)?;\n             } else {\n                 cb(&entry);\n             }\n         }\n     }\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n ```rust,no_run\n use std::{fs, io};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut entries = fs::read_dir(\".\")?\n         .map(|res| res.map(|e| e.path()))\n         .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, io::Error>>()?;\n\n     // The order in which `read_dir` returns entries is not guaranteed. If reproducible\n     // ordering is required the entries should be explicitly sorted.\n\n     entries.sort();\n\n     // The entries have now been sorted by their path.\n\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
