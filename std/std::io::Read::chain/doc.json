  "doc": " Creates an adapter which will chain this stream with another.\n\n The returned `Read` instance will first read all bytes from this object\n until EOF is encountered. Afterwards the output is equivalent to the\n output of `next`.\n\n # Examples\n\n [`File`]s implement `Read`:\n\n [`File`]: crate::fs::File\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io;\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::fs::File;\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let f1 = File::open(\"foo.txt\")?;\n     let f2 = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?;\n\n     let mut handle = f1.chain(f2);\n     let mut buffer = String::new();\n\n     // read the value into a String. We could use any Read method here,\n     // this is just one example.\n     handle.read_to_string(&mut buffer)?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
