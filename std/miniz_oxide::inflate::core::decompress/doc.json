  "doc": " Main decompression function. Keeps decompressing data from `in_buf` until the `in_buf` is\n empty, `out` is full, the end of the deflate stream is hit, or there is an error in the\n deflate stream.\n\n # Arguments\n\n `r` is a [`DecompressorOxide`] struct with the state of this stream.\n\n `in_buf` is a reference to the compressed data that is to be decompressed. The decompressor will\n start at the first byte of this buffer.\n\n `out` is a reference to the buffer that will store the decompressed data, and that\n stores previously decompressed data if any.\n\n * The offset given by `out_pos` indicates where in the output buffer slice writing should start.\n * If [`TINFL_FLAG_USING_NON_WRAPPING_OUTPUT_BUF`] is not set, the output buffer is used in a\n   wrapping manner, and it's size is required to be a power of 2.\n * The decompression function normally needs access to 32KiB of the previously decompressed data\n   (or to the beginning of the decompressed data if less than 32KiB has been decompressed.)\n     - If this data is not available, decompression may fail.\n     - Some deflate compressors allow specifying a window size which limits match distances to\n       less than this, or alternatively an RLE mode where matches will only refer to the previous byte\n       and thus allows a smaller output buffer. The window size can be specified in the zlib\n       header structure, however, the header data should not be relied on to be correct.\n\n `flags` indicates settings and status to the decompression function.\n * The [`TINFL_FLAG_HAS_MORE_INPUT`] has to be specified if more compressed data is to be provided\n   in a subsequent call to this function.\n * See the the [`inflate_flags`] module for details on other flags.\n\n # Returns\n\n Returns a tuple containing the status of the compressor, the number of input bytes read, and the\n number of bytes output to `out`.\n"
