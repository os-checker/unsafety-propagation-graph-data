Keeps the\n allocated memory for reuse.\n\n If the returned iterator is dropped before being fully consumed, it\n drops the remaining elements. The returned iterator keeps a mutable\n borrow on the set to optimize its implementation.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashSet;\n\n let mut set = HashSet::from([1, 2, 3]);\n assert!(!set.is_empty());\n\n // print 1, 2, 3 in an arbitrary order\n for i in set.drain() {\n     println!(\"{i}\");\n }\n\n assert!(set.is_empty());\n ```\n"
