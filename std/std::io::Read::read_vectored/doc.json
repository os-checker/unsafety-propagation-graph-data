  "doc": " Like `read`, except that it reads into a slice of buffers.\n\n Data is copied to fill each buffer in order, with the final buffer\n written to possibly being only partially filled. This method must\n behave equivalently to a single call to `read` with concatenated\n buffers.\n\n The default implementation calls `read` with either the first nonempty\n buffer provided, or an empty one if none exists.\n"
