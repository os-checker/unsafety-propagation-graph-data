  "doc": " Writes some data into this BufReader with line buffering.\n\n This means that, if any newlines are present in the data, the data up to\n the last newline is sent directly to the underlying writer, and data\n after it is buffered. Returns the number of bytes written.\n\n This function operates on a \"best effort basis\"; in keeping with the\n convention of `Write::write`, it makes at most one attempt to write\n new data to the underlying writer. If that write only reports a partial\n success, the remaining data will be buffered.\n\n Because this function attempts to send completed lines to the underlying\n writer, it will also flush the existing buffer if it ends with a\n newline, even if the incoming data does not contain any newlines.\n"
