  "doc": " Moves this TCP stream into or out of nonblocking mode.\n\n This will result in the `accept` operation becoming nonblocking,\n i.e., immediately returning from their calls. If the IO operation is\n successful, `Ok` is returned and no further action is required. If the\n IO operation could not be completed and needs to be retried, an error\n with kind [`io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`] is returned.\n\n On Unix platforms, calling this method corresponds to calling `fcntl`\n `FIONBIO`. On Windows calling this method corresponds to calling\n `ioctlsocket` `FIONBIO`.\n\n # Examples\n\n Bind a TCP listener to an address, listen for connections, and read\n bytes in nonblocking mode:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io;\n use std::net::TcpListener;\n\n let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:7878\").unwrap();\n listener.set_nonblocking(true).expect(\"Cannot set non-blocking\");\n\n # fn wait_for_fd() { unimplemented!() }\n # fn handle_connection(stream: std::net::TcpStream) { unimplemented!() }\n for stream in listener.incoming() {\n     match stream {\n         Ok(s) => {\n             // do something with the TcpStream\n             handle_connection(s);\n         }\n         Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock => {\n             // wait until network socket is ready, typically implemented\n             // via platform-specific APIs such as epoll or IOCP\n             wait_for_fd();\n             continue;\n         }\n         Err(e) => panic!(\"encountered IO error: {e}\"),\n     }\n }\n ```\n"
