  "doc": " Recursively create a directory and all of its parent components if they\n are missing.\n\n This function is not atomic. If it returns an error, any parent components it was able to create\n will remain.\n\n If the empty path is passed to this function, it always succeeds without\n creating any directories.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to multiple calls to the `mkdir`\n function on Unix and the `CreateDirectoryW` function on Windows.\n\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n The function will return an error if any directory specified in path does not exist and\n could not be created. There may be other error conditions; see [`fs::create_dir`] for specifics.\n\n Notable exception is made for situations where any of the directories\n specified in the `path` could not be created as it was being created concurrently.\n Such cases are considered to be successful. That is, calling `create_dir_all`\n concurrently from multiple threads or processes is guaranteed not to fail\n due to a race condition with itself.\n\n [`fs::create_dir`]: create_dir\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::create_dir_all(\"/some/dir\")?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
