  "doc": " Waits for a message to be sent into the channel, but only until a given deadline.\n\n If the channel is full and not disconnected, this call will block until the send operation\n can proceed or the operation times out. If the channel becomes disconnected, this call will\n wake up and return an error. The returned error contains the original message.\n\n If called on a zero-capacity channel, this method will wait for a receive operation to\n appear on the other side of the channel.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(mpmc_channel)]\n\n use std::sync::mpmc::channel;\n use std::time::{Duration, Instant};\n\n let (tx, rx) = channel();\n\n let t = Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(400);\n tx.send_deadline(1, t).unwrap();\n ```\n"
