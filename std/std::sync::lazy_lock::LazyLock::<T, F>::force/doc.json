  "doc": " Forces the evaluation of this lazy value and returns a reference to\n result. This is equivalent to the `Deref` impl, but is explicit.\n\n This method will block the calling thread if another initialization\n routine is currently running.\n\n # Panics\n\n If the initialization closure panics (the one that is passed to the [`new()`] method), the\n panic is propagated to the caller, and the lock becomes poisoned. This will cause all future\n accesses of the lock (via [`force()`] or a dereference) to panic.\n\n [`new()`]: LazyLock::new\n [`force()`]: LazyLock::force\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::LazyLock;\n\n let lazy = LazyLock::new(|| 92);\n\n assert_eq!(LazyLock::force(&lazy), &92);\n assert_eq!(&*lazy, &92);\n ```\n"
