  "doc": " Writes some data into this BufReader with line buffering.\n\n This means that, if any newlines are present in the data, the data up to\n the last newline is sent directly to the underlying writer, and data\n after it is buffered.\n\n Because this function attempts to send completed lines to the underlying\n writer, it will also flush the existing buffer if it contains any\n newlines, even if the incoming data does not contain any newlines.\n"
