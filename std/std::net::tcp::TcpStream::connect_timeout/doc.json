  "doc": " Opens a TCP connection to a remote host with a timeout.\n\n Unlike `connect`, `connect_timeout` takes a single [`SocketAddr`] since\n timeout must be applied to individual addresses.\n\n It is an error to pass a zero `Duration` to this function.\n\n Unlike other methods on `TcpStream`, this does not correspond to a\n single system call. It instead calls `connect` in nonblocking mode and\n then uses an OS-specific mechanism to await the completion of the\n connection request.\n"
