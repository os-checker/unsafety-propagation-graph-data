  "doc": " Makes a [`MappedMutexGuard`] for a component of the borrowed data. The\n original guard is returned as an `Err(...)` if the closure returns\n `None`.\n\n The `Mutex` is already locked, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `MutexGuard::filter_map(...)`. A method would interfere with methods of the\n same name on the contents of the `MutexGuard` used through `Deref`.\n"
