  "span": "$library/std/src/collections/hash/map.rs:347:5: 347:84",
  "doc": " Creates an empty `HashMap` with at least the specified capacity, using\n `hasher` to hash the keys.\n\n The hash map will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without\n reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than\n `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the hash map will not allocate.\n\n Warning: `hasher` is normally randomly generated, and\n is designed to allow HashMaps to be resistant to attacks that\n cause many collisions and very poor performance. Setting it\n manually using this function can expose a DoS attack vector.\n\n The `hasher` passed should implement the [`BuildHasher`] trait for\n the `HashMap` to be useful, see its documentation for details.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashMap;\n use std::hash::RandomState;\n\n let s = RandomState::new();\n let mut map = HashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher(10, s);\n map.insert(1, 2);\n ```\n"
