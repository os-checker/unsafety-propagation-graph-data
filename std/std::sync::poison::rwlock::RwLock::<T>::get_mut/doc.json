  "doc": " Returns a mutable reference to the underlying data.\n\n Since this call borrows the `RwLock` mutably, no actual locking needs to\n take place -- the mutable borrow statically guarantees no new locks can be acquired\n while this reference exists. Note that this method does not clear any previously abandoned\n locks (e.g., via [`forget()`] on a [`RwLockReadGuard`] or [`RwLockWriteGuard`]).\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error containing a mutable reference to\n the underlying data if the `RwLock` is poisoned. An `RwLock` is\n poisoned whenever a writer panics while holding an exclusive lock.\n An error will only be returned if the lock would have otherwise been\n acquired.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::RwLock;\n\n let mut lock = RwLock::new(0);\n *lock.get_mut().unwrap() = 10;\n assert_eq!(*lock.read().unwrap(), 10);\n ```\n"
