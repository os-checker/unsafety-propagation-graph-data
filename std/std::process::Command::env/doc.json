  "doc": " Inserts or updates an explicit environment variable mapping.\n\n This method allows you to add an environment variable mapping to the spawned process or\n overwrite a previously set value. You can use [`Command::envs`] to set multiple environment\n variables simultaneously.\n\n Child processes will inherit environment variables from their parent process by default.\n Environment variables explicitly set using [`Command::env`] take precedence over inherited\n variables. You can disable environment variable inheritance entirely using\n [`Command::env_clear`] or for a single key using [`Command::env_remove`].\n\n Note that environment variable names are case-insensitive (but\n case-preserving) on Windows and case-sensitive on all other platforms.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process::Command;\n\n Command::new(\"ls\")\n     .env(\"PATH\", \"/bin\")\n     .spawn()\n     .expect(\"ls command failed to start\");\n ```\n"
