  "doc": " Complementary error function.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `erfcf128` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n #![feature(float_erf)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f128_math)] {\n let x: f128 = 0.123;\n\n let one = x.erf() + x.erfc();\n let abs_difference = (one - 1.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
