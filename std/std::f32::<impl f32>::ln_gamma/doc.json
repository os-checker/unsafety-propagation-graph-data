  "doc": " Natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma function\n\n The integer part of the tuple indicates the sign of the gamma function.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `lgamma_r` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(float_gamma)]\n let x = 2.0f32;\n\n let abs_difference = (x.ln_gamma().0 - 0.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f32::EPSILON);\n ```\n"
