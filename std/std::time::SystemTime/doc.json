  "doc": " A measurement of the system clock, useful for talking to\n external entities like the file system or other processes.\n\n Distinct from the [`Instant`] type, this time measurement **is not\n monotonic**. This means that you can save a file to the file system, then\n save another file to the file system, **and the second file has a\n `SystemTime` measurement earlier than the first**. In other words, an\n operation that happens after another operation in real time may have an\n earlier `SystemTime`!\n\n Consequently, comparing two `SystemTime` instances to learn about the\n duration between them returns a [`Result`] instead of an infallible [`Duration`]\n to indicate that this sort of time drift may happen and needs to be handled.\n\n Although a `SystemTime` cannot be directly inspected, the [`UNIX_EPOCH`]\n constant is provided in this module as an anchor in time to learn\n information about a `SystemTime`. By calculating the duration from this\n fixed point in time, a `SystemTime` can be converted to a human-readable time,\n or perhaps some other string representation.\n\n The size of a `SystemTime` struct may vary depending on the target operating\n system.\n\n A `SystemTime` does not count leap seconds.\n `SystemTime::now()`'s behavior around a leap second\n is the same as the operating system's wall clock.\n The precise behavior near a leap second\n (e.g. whether the clock appears to run slow or fast, or stop, or jump)\n depends on platform and configuration,\n so should not be relied on.\n\n Example:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};\n use std::thread::sleep;\n\n fn main() {\n    let now = SystemTime::now();\n\n    // we sleep for 2 seconds\n    sleep(Duration::new(2, 0));\n    match now.elapsed() {\n        Ok(elapsed) => {\n            // it prints '2'\n            println!(\"{}\", elapsed.as_secs());\n        }\n        Err(e) => {\n            // the system clock went backwards!\n            println!(\"Great Scott! {e:?}\");\n        }\n    }\n }\n ```\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n The precision of `SystemTime` can depend on the underlying OS-specific time format.\n For example, on Windows the time is represented in 100 nanosecond intervals whereas Linux\n can represent nanosecond intervals.\n\n The following system calls are [currently] being used by `now()` to find out\n the current time:\n\n |  Platform |               System call                                            |\n |-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n | SGX       | [`insecure_time` usercall].
