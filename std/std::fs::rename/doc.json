  "doc": " Renames a file or directory to a new name, replacing the original file if\n `to` already exists.\n\n This will not work if the new name is on a different mount point.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `rename` function on Unix\n and the `MoveFileExW` or `SetFileInformationByHandle` function on Windows.\n\n Because of this, the behavior when both `from` and `to` exist differs. On\n Unix, if `from` is a directory, `to` must also be an (empty) directory. If\n `from` is not a directory, `to` must also be not a directory. The behavior\n on Windows is the same on Windows 10 1607 and higher if `FileRenameInfoEx`\n is supported by the filesystem; otherwise, `from` can be anything, but\n `to` must *not* be a directory.\n\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not\n limited to just these cases:\n\n * `from` does not exist.\n * The user lacks permissions to view contents.\n * `from` and `to` are on separate filesystems.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::rename(\"a.txt\", \"b.txt\")?; // Rename a.txt to b.txt\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
