  "doc": " Moves the socket into or out of nonblocking mode.\n\n This will result in the `accept` operation becoming nonblocking,\n i.e., immediately returning from their calls. If the IO operation is\n successful, `Ok` is returned and no further action is required. If the\n IO operation could not be completed and needs to be retried, an error\n with kind [`io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`] is returned.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::os::unix::net::UnixListener;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let listener = UnixListener::bind(\"/path/to/the/socket\")?;\n     listener.set_nonblocking(true).expect(\"Couldn't set non blocking\");\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
