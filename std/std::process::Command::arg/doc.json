  "doc": " Adds an argument to pass to the program.\n\n Only one argument can be passed per use. So instead of:\n\n ```no_run\n # std::process::Command::new(\"sh\")\n .arg(\"-C /path/to/repo\")\n # ;\n ```\n\n usage would be:\n\n ```no_run\n # std::process::Command::new(\"sh\")\n .arg(\"-C\")\n .arg(\"/path/to/repo\")\n # ;\n ```\n\n To pass multiple arguments see [`args`].\n\n [`args`]: Command::args\n\n Note that the argument is not passed through a shell, but given\n literally to the program. This means that shell syntax like quotes,\n escaped characters, word splitting, glob patterns, variable substitution,\n etc. have no effect.\n\n <div class=\"warning\">\n\n On Windows, use caution with untrusted inputs. Most applications use the\n standard convention for decoding arguments passed to them. These are safe to\n use with `arg`. However, some applications such as `cmd.exe` and `.bat` files\n use a non-standard way of decoding arguments. They are therefore vulnerable\n to malicious input.\n\n In the case of `cmd.exe` this is especially important because a malicious\n argument can potentially run arbitrary shell commands.\n\n See [Windows argument splitting][windows-args] for more details\n or [`raw_arg`] for manually implementing non-standard argument encoding.\n\n [`raw_arg`]: crate::os::windows::process::CommandExt::raw_arg\n [windows-args]: crate::process#windows-argument-splitting\n\n </div>\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process::Command;\n\n Command::new(\"ls\")\n     .arg(\"-l\")\n     .arg(\"-a\")\n     .spawn()\n     .expect(\"ls command failed to start\");\n ```\n"
