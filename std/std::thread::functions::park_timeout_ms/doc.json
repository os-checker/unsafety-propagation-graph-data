  "doc": " Uses [`park_timeout`].\n\n Blocks unless or until the current thread's token is made available or\n the specified duration has been reached (may wake spuriously).\n\n The semantics of this function are equivalent to [`park`] except\n that the thread will be blocked for roughly no longer than `dur`. This\n method should not be used for precise timing due to anomalies such as\n preemption or platform differences that might not cause the maximum\n amount of time waited to be precisely `ms` long.\n\n See the [park documentation][`park`] for more detail.\n"
