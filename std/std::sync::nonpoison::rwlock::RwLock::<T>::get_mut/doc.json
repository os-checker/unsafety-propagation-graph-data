  "span": "$library/std/src/sync/nonpoison/rwlock.rs:486:5: 486:40",
  "doc": " Returns a mutable reference to the underlying data.\n\n Since this call borrows the `RwLock` mutably, no actual locking needs to\n take place -- the mutable borrow statically guarantees no new locks can be acquired\n while this reference exists. Note that this method does not clear any previously abandoned\n locks (e.g., via [`forget()`] on a [`RwLockReadGuard`] or [`RwLockWriteGuard`]).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(nonpoison_rwlock)]\n\n use std::sync::nonpoison::RwLock;\n\n let mut lock = RwLock::new(0);\n *lock.get_mut() = 10;\n assert_eq!(*lock.read(), 10);\n ```\n"
