  "doc": " Removes a file from the filesystem.\n\n Note that there is no\n guarantee that the file is immediately deleted (e.g., depending on\n platform, other open file descriptors may prevent immediate removal).\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `unlink` function on Unix.\n On Windows, `DeleteFile` is used or `CreateFileW` and `SetInformationByHandle` for readonly files.\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not\n limited to just these cases:\n\n * `path` points to a directory.\n * The file doesn't exist.\n * The user lacks permissions to remove the file.\n\n This function will only ever return an error of kind `NotFound` if the given\n path does not exist. Note that the inverse is not true,\n ie. if a path does not exist, its removal may fail for a number of reasons,\n such as insufficient permissions.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::remove_file(\"a.txt\")?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
