  "doc": " Checks if the associated thread has finished running its main function.\n\n `is_finished` supports implementing a non-blocking join operation, by checking\n `is_finished`, and calling `join` if it returns `true`. This function does not block. To\n block while waiting on the thread to finish, use [`join`][Self::join].\n\n This might return `true` for a brief moment after the thread's main\n function has returned, but before the thread itself has stopped running.\n However, once this returns `true`, [`join`][Self::join] can be expected\n to return quickly, without blocking for any significant amount of time.\n"
