  "doc": " Disassembles this `BufWriter<W>`, returning the underlying writer, and any buffered but\n unwritten data.\n\n If the underlying writer panicked, it is not known what portion of the data was written.\n In this case, we return `WriterPanicked` for the buffered data (from which the buffer\n contents can still be recovered).\n\n `into_parts` makes no attempt to flush data and cannot fail.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::io::{BufWriter, Write};\n\n let mut buffer = [0u8; 10];\n let mut stream = BufWriter::new(buffer.as_mut());\n write!(stream, \"too much data\").unwrap();\n stream.flush().expect_err(\"it doesn't fit\");\n let (recovered_writer, buffered_data) = stream.into_parts();\n assert_eq!(recovered_writer.len(), 0);\n assert_eq!(&buffered_data.unwrap(), b\"ata\");\n ```\n"
