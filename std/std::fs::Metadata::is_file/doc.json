  "doc": " Returns `true` if this metadata is for a regular file. The\n result is mutually exclusive to the result of\n [`Metadata::is_dir`], and will be false for symlink metadata\n obtained from [`symlink_metadata`].\n\n When the goal is simply to read from (or write to) the source, the most\n reliable way to test the source can be read (or written to) is to open\n it. Only using `is_file` can break workflows like `diff <( prog_a )` on\n a Unix-like system for example. See [`File::open`] or\n [`OpenOptions::open`] for more information.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let metadata = fs::metadata(\"foo.txt\")?;\n\n     assert!(metadata.is_file());\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
