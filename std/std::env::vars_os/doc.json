Modifications to environment\n variables afterwards will not be reflected in the returned iterator.\n\n Note that the returned iterator will not check if the environment variables\n are valid Unicode. If you want to panic on invalid UTF-8,\n use the [`vars`] function instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n // Print all environment variables.\n for (key, value) in std::env::vars_os() {\n     println!(\"{key:?}: {value:?}\");\n }\n ```\n"
