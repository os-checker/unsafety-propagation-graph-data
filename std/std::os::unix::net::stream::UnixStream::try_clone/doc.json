  "doc": " Creates a new independently owned handle to the underlying socket.\n\n The returned `UnixStream` is a reference to the same stream that this\n object references. Both handles will read and write the same stream of\n data, and options set on one stream will be propagated to the other\n stream.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::os::unix::net::UnixStream;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let socket = UnixStream::connect(\"/tmp/sock\")?;\n     let sock_copy = socket.try_clone().expect(\"Couldn't clone socket\");\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
