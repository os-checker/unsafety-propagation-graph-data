  "doc": " Computes the arctangent of a number. Return value is in radians in the\n range [-pi/2, pi/2];\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `atanf128` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f128_math)] {\n\n let f = 1.0f128;\n\n // atan(tan(1))\n let abs_difference = (f.tan().atan() - 1.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
