  "doc": " Spawns a new thread within a scope, returning a [`ScopedJoinHandle`] for it.\n\n Unlike non-scoped threads, threads spawned with this function may\n borrow non-`'static` data from the outside the scope. See [`scope`] for\n details.\n\n The join handle provides a [`join`] method that can be used to join the spawned\n thread. If the spawned thread panics, [`join`] will return an [`Err`] containing\n the panic payload.\n\n If the join handle is dropped, the spawned thread will be implicitly joined at the\n end of the scope. In that case, if the spawned thread panics, [`scope`] will\n panic after all threads are joined.\n\n This function creates a thread with the default parameters of [`Builder`].\n To specify the new thread's stack size or the name, use [`Builder::spawn_scoped`].\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if the OS fails to create a thread; use [`Builder::spawn_scoped`]\n to recover from such errors.\n\n [`join`]: ScopedJoinHandle::join\n"
