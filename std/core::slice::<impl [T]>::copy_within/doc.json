  "doc": " Copies elements from one part of the slice to another part of itself,\n using a memmove.\n\n `src` is the range within `self` to copy from. `dest` is the starting\n index of the range within `self` to copy to, which will have the same\n length as `src`. The two ranges may overlap. The ends of the two ranges\n must be less than or equal to `self.len()`.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if either range exceeds the end of the slice,\n or if the end of `src` is before the start.\n\n # Examples\n\n Copying four bytes within a slice:\n\n ```\n let mut bytes = *b\"Hello, World!\";\n\n bytes.copy_within(1..5, 8);\n\n assert_eq!(&bytes, b\"Hello, Wello!\");\n ```\n"
