  "doc": " Schedules a closure to be run just before the `exec` function is\n invoked.\n\n `before_exec` used to be a safe method, but it needs to be unsafe since the closure may only\n perform operations that are *async-signal-safe*. Hence it got deprecated in favor of the\n unsafe [`pre_exec`]. Meanwhile, Rust gained the ability to make an existing safe method\n fully unsafe in a new edition, which is how `before_exec` became `unsafe`. It still also\n remains deprecated; `pre_exec` should be used instead.\n\n [`pre_exec`]: CommandExt::pre_exec\n"
