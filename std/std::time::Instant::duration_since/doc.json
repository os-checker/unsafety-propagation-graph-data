  "doc": " Returns the amount of time elapsed from another instant to this one,\n or zero duration if that instant is later than this one.\n\n # Panics\n\n Previous Rust versions panicked when `earlier` was later than `self`. Currently this\n method saturates. Future versions may reintroduce the panic in some circumstances.\n See [Monotonicity].\n\n [Monotonicity]: Instant#monotonicity\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::time::{Duration, Instant};\n use std::thread::sleep;\n\n let now = Instant::now();\n sleep(Duration::new(1, 0));\n let new_now = Instant::now();\n println!(\"{:?}\", new_now.duration_since(now));\n println!(\"{:?}\", now.duration_since(new_now)); // 0ns\n ```\n"
