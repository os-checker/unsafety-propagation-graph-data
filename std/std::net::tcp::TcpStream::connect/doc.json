  "doc": " Opens a TCP connection to a remote host.\n\n `addr` is an address of the remote host. Anything which implements\n [`ToSocketAddrs`] trait can be supplied for the address; see this trait\n documentation for concrete examples.\n\n If `addr` yields multiple addresses, `connect` will be attempted with\n each of the addresses until a connection is successful. If none of\n the addresses result in a successful connection, the error returned from\n the last connection attempt (the last address) is returned.\n\n # Examples\n\n Open a TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:8080`:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::TcpStream;\n\n if let Ok(stream) = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:8080\") {\n     println!(\"Connected to the server!\");\n } else {\n     println!(\"Couldn't connect to server...\");\n }\n ```\n\n Open a TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:8080`. If the connection fails, open\n a TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:8081`:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::{SocketAddr, TcpStream};\n\n let addrs = [\n     SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 8080)),\n     SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 8081)),\n ];\n if let Ok(stream) = TcpStream::connect(&addrs[..]) {\n     println!(\"Connected to the server!\");\n } else {\n     println!(\"Couldn't connect to server...\");\n }\n ```\n"
