  "span": "$library/std/src/num/f16.rs:694:5: 694:30",
  "doc": " Returns `ln(1+n)` (natural logarithm) more accurately than if\n the operations were performed separately.\n\n This returns NaN when `n < -1.0`, and negative infinity when `n == -1.0`.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `log1pf` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f16)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f16_math)] {\n\n let x = 1e-4_f16;\n\n // for very small x, ln(1 + x) is approximately x - x^2 / 2\n let approx = x - x * x / 2.0;\n let abs_difference = (x.ln_1p() - approx).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference < 1e-4);\n # }\n ```\n\n Out-of-range values:\n ```\n #![feature(f16)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f16_math)] {\n\n assert_eq!((-1.0_f16).ln_1p(), f16::NEG_INFINITY);\n assert!((-2.0_f16).ln_1p().is_nan());\n # }\n ```\n"
