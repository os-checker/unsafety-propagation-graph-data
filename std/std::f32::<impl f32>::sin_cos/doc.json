  "doc": " Simultaneously computes the sine and cosine of the number, `x`. Returns\n `(sin(x), cos(x))`.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `(f32::sin(x),\n f32::cos(x))`. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = std::f32::consts::FRAC_PI_4;\n let f = x.sin_cos();\n\n let abs_difference_0 = (f.0 - x.sin()).abs();\n let abs_difference_1 = (f.1 - x.cos()).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference_0 <= 1e-4);\n assert!(abs_difference_1 <= 1e-4);\n ```\n"
