  "doc": " Creates a new empty hash set which will use the given hasher to hash\n keys.\n\n The hash set is also created with the default initial capacity.\n\n Warning: `hasher` is normally randomly generated, and\n is designed to allow `HashSet`s to be resistant to attacks that\n cause many collisions and very poor performance. Setting it\n manually using this function can expose a DoS attack vector.\n\n The `hash_builder` passed should implement the [`BuildHasher`] trait for\n the `HashSet` to be useful, see its documentation for details.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashSet;\n use std::hash::RandomState;\n\n let s = RandomState::new();\n let mut set = HashSet::with_hasher(s);\n set.insert(2);\n ```\n"
