  "doc": " Takes the value out of this `OnceLock`, moving it back to an uninitialized state.\n\n Has no effect and returns `None` if the `OnceLock` was uninitialized.\n\n Since this method borrows the `OnceLock` mutably, it is statically guaranteed that\n no active borrows to the `OnceLock` exist, including from other threads.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n let mut cell: OnceLock<String> = OnceLock::new();\n assert_eq!(cell.take(), None);\n\n let mut cell = OnceLock::new();\n cell.set(\"hello\".to_string()).unwrap();\n assert_eq!(cell.take(), Some(\"hello\".to_string()));\n assert_eq!(cell.get(), None);\n ```\n"
