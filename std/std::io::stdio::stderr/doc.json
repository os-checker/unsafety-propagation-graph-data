  "doc": " Constructs a new handle to the standard error of the current process.\n\n This handle is not buffered.\n\n ### Note: Windows Portability Considerations\n\n When operating in a console, the Windows implementation of this stream does not support\n non-UTF-8 byte sequences. Attempting to write bytes that are not valid UTF-8 will return\n an error.\n\n In a process with a detached console, such as one using\n `#![windows_subsystem = \"windows\"]`, or in a child process spawned from such a process,\n the contained handle will be null. In such cases, the standard library's `Read` and\n `Write` will do nothing and silently succeed. All other I/O operations, via the\n standard library or via raw Windows API calls, will fail.\n\n # Examples\n\n Using implicit synchronization:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::{self, Write};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     io::stderr().write_all(b\"hello world\")?;\n\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n Using explicit synchronization:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::{self, Write};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let stderr = io::stderr();\n     let mut handle = stderr.lock();\n\n     handle.write_all(b\"hello world\")?;\n\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
