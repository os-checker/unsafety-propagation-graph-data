  "doc": " Constructs a new handle to the standard output of the current process.\n\n Each handle returned is a reference to a shared global buffer whose access\n is synchronized via a mutex. If you need more explicit control over\n locking, see the [`Stdout::lock`] method.\n\n By default, the handle is line-buffered when connected to a terminal, meaning\n it flushes automatically when a newline (`\\n`) is encountered. For immediate\n output, you can manually call the [`flush`] method. When the handle goes out\n of scope, the buffer is automatically flushed.\n\n ### Note: Windows Portability Considerations\n\n When operating in a console, the Windows implementation of this stream does not support\n non-UTF-8 byte sequences. Attempting to write bytes that are not valid UTF-8 will return\n an error.\n\n In a process with a detached console, such as one using\n `#![windows_subsystem = \"windows\"]`, or in a child process spawned from such a process,\n the contained handle will be null. In such cases, the standard library's `Read` and\n `Write` will do nothing and silently succeed. All other I/O operations, via the\n standard library or via raw Windows API calls, will fail.\n\n # Examples\n\n Using implicit synchronization:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::{self, Write};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     io::stdout().write_all(b\"hello world\")?;\n\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n Using explicit synchronization:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::{self, Write};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let stdout = io::stdout();\n     let mut handle = stdout.lock();\n\n     handle.write_all(b\"hello world\")?;\n\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n Ensuring output is flushed immediately:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::{self, Write};\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut stdout = io::stdout();\n     stdout.write_all(b\"hello, \")?;\n     stdout.flush()?;                // Manual flush\n     stdout.write_all(b\"world!\\n\")?; // Automatically flushed\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n [`flush`]: Write::flush\n"
