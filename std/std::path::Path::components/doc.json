  "doc": " Produces an iterator over the [`Component`]s of the path.\n\n When parsing the path, there is a small amount of normalization:\n\n * Repeated separators are ignored, so `a/b` and `a//b` both have\n   `a` and `b` as components.\n\n * Occurrences of `.` are normalized away, except if they are at the\n   beginning of the path. For example, `a/./b`, `a/b/`, `a/b/.` and\n   `a/b` all have `a` and `b` as components, but `./a/b` starts with\n   an additional [`CurDir`] component.\n\n * Trailing separators are normalized away, so `/a/b` and `/a/b/` are equivalent.\n\n Note that no other normalization takes place; in particular, `a/c`\n and `a/b/../c` are distinct, to account for the possibility that `b`\n is a symbolic link (so its parent isn't `a`).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::path::{Path, Component};\n use std::ffi::OsStr;\n\n let mut components = Path::new(\"/tmp/foo.txt\").components();\n\n assert_eq!(components.next(), Some(Component::RootDir));\n assert_eq!(components.next(), Some(Component::Normal(OsStr::new(\"tmp\"))));\n assert_eq!(components.next(), Some(Component::Normal(OsStr::new(\"foo.txt\"))));\n assert_eq!(components.next(), None)\n ```\n\n [`CurDir`]: Component::CurDir\n"
