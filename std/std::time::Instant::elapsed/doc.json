Currently this\n method returns a Duration of zero in that case. Future versions may reintroduce the panic.\n See [Monotonicity].\n\n [Monotonicity]: Instant#monotonicity\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::thread::sleep;\n use std::time::{Duration, Instant};\n\n let instant = Instant::now();\n let three_secs = Duration::from_secs(3);\n sleep(three_secs);\n assert!(instant.elapsed() >= three_secs);\n ```\n"
