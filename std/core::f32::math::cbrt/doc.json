  "doc": " Experimental version of `cbrt` in `core`. See [`f32::cbrt`] for details.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `cbrtf` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(core_float_math)]\n\n use core::f32;\n\n let x = 8.0f32;\n\n // x^(1/3) - 2 == 0\n let abs_difference = (f32::math::cbrt(x) - 2.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= 1e-6);\n ```\n\n _This standalone function is for testing only.\n It will be stabilized as an inherent method._\n\n [`f32::cbrt`]: ../../../std/primitive.f32.html#method.cbrt\n"
