  "doc": " Subtracts an unsigned offset in bytes from a pointer using wrapping arithmetic.\n\n `count` is in units of bytes.\n\n This is purely a convenience for casting to a `u8` pointer and\n using [wrapping_sub][pointer::wrapping_sub] on it. See that method for documentation.\n\n For non-`Sized` pointees this operation changes only the data pointer,\n leaving the metadata untouched.\n"
