  "doc": " Tries to reserve capacity for at least `additional` more elements to be inserted\n in the `HashSet`. The collection may reserve more space to speculatively\n avoid frequent reallocations. After calling `try_reserve`,\n capacity will be greater than or equal to `self.len() + additional` if\n it returns `Ok(())`.\n Does nothing if capacity is already sufficient.\n\n # Errors\n\n If the capacity overflows, or the allocator reports a failure, then an error\n is returned.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashSet;\n let mut set: HashSet<i32> = HashSet::new();\n set.try_reserve(10).expect(\"why is the test harness OOMing on a handful of bytes?\");\n ```\n"
