  "doc": " Consumes this object, returning the raw underlying file descriptor.\n\n This function is typically used to **transfer ownership** of the underlying\n file descriptor to the caller. When used in this way, callers are then the unique\n owners of the file descriptor and must close it once it's no longer needed.\n\n However, transferring ownership is not strictly required. Use a\n [`Into<OwnedFd>::into`] implementation for an API which strictly\n transfers ownership.\n\n # Example\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::File;\n # use std::io;\n #[cfg(any(unix, target_os = \"wasi\"))]\n use std::os::fd::{IntoRawFd, RawFd};\n\n let f = File::open(\"foo.txt\")?;\n #[cfg(any(unix, target_os = \"wasi\"))]\n let raw_fd: RawFd = f.into_raw_fd();\n # Ok::<(), io::Error>(())\n ```\n"
