  "doc": " Removes an empty directory.\n\n If you want to remove a directory that is not empty, as well as all\n of its contents recursively, consider using [`remove_dir_all`]\n instead.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `rmdir` function on Unix\n and the `RemoveDirectory` function on Windows.\n Note that, this [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not\n limited to just these cases:\n\n * `path` doesn't exist.\n * `path` isn't a directory.\n * The user lacks permissions to remove the directory at the provided `path`.\n * The directory isn't empty.\n\n This function will only ever return an error of kind `NotFound` if the given\n path does not exist. Note that the inverse is not true,\n ie. if a path does not exist, its removal may fail for a number of reasons,\n such as insufficient permissions.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::remove_dir(\"/some/dir\")?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
