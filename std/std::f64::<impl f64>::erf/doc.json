  "doc": " Error function.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `erf` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(float_erf)]\n /// The error function relates what percent of a normal distribution lies\n /// within `x` standard deviations (scaled by `1/sqrt(2)`).\n fn within_standard_deviations(x: f64) -> f64 {\n     (x * std::f64::consts::FRAC_1_SQRT_2).erf() * 100.0\n }\n\n // 68% of a normal distribution is within one standard deviation\n assert!((within_standard_deviations(1.0) - 68.269).abs() < 0.01);\n // 95% of a normal distribution is within two standard deviations\n assert!((within_standard_deviations(2.0) - 95.450).abs() < 0.01);\n // 99.7% of a normal distribution is within three standard deviations\n assert!((within_standard_deviations(3.0) - 99.730).abs() < 0.01);\n ```\n"
