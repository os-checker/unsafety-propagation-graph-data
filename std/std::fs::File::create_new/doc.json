  "doc": " Creates a new file in read-write mode; error if the file exists.\n\n This function will create a file if it does not exist, or return an error if it does. This\n way, if the call succeeds, the file returned is guaranteed to be new.\n If a file exists at the target location, creating a new file will fail with [`AlreadyExists`]\n or another error based on the situation. See [`OpenOptions::open`] for a\n non-exhaustive list of likely errors.\n\n This option is useful because it is atomic. Otherwise between checking whether a file\n exists and creating a new one, the file may have been created by another process (a [TOCTOU]\n race condition / attack).\n\n This can also be written using\n `File::options().read(true).write(true).create_new(true).open(...)`.\n\n [`AlreadyExists`]: crate::io::ErrorKind::AlreadyExists\n [TOCTOU]: self#time-of-check-to-time-of-use-toctou\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::File;\n use std::io::Write;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let mut f = File::create_new(\"foo.txt\")?;\n     f.write_all(\"Hello, world!\".as_bytes())?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
