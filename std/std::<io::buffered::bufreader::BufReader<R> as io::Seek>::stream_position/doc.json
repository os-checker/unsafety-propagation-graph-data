  "span": "$library/std/src/io/buffered/bufreader.rs:553:5: 553:53",
  "doc": " Returns the current seek position from the start of the stream.\n\n The value returned is equivalent to `self.seek(SeekFrom::Current(0))`\n but does not flush the internal buffer. Due to this optimization the\n function does not guarantee that calling `.into_inner()` immediately\n afterwards will yield the underlying reader at the same position. Use\n [`BufReader::seek`] instead if you require that guarantee.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function will panic if the position of the inner reader is smaller\n than the amount of buffered data. That can happen if the inner reader\n has an incorrect implementation of [`Seek::stream_position`], or if the\n position has gone out of sync due to calling [`Seek::seek`] directly on\n the underlying reader.\n\n # Example\n\n ```no_run\n use std::{\n     io::{self, BufRead, BufReader, Seek},\n     fs::File,\n };\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut f = BufReader::new(File::open(\"foo.txt\")?);\n\n     let before = f.stream_position()?;\n     f.read_line(&mut String::new())?;\n     let after = f.stream_position()?;\n\n     println!(\"The first line was {} bytes long\", after - before);\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
