  "doc": " Returns an iterator of the environment variables explicitly set for the child process.\n\n Environment variables explicitly set using [`Command::env`], [`Command::envs`], and\n [`Command::env_remove`] can be retrieved with this method.\n\n Note that this output does not include environment variables inherited from the parent\n process.\n\n Each element is a tuple key/value pair `(&OsStr, Option<&OsStr>)`. A [`None`] value\n indicates its key was explicitly removed via [`Command::env_remove`]. The associated key for\n the [`None`] value will no longer inherit from its parent process.\n\n An empty iterator can indicate that no explicit mappings were added or that\n [`Command::env_clear`] was called. After calling [`Command::env_clear`], the child process\n will not inherit any environment variables from its parent process.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::ffi::OsStr;\n use std::process::Command;\n\n let mut cmd = Command::new(\"ls\");\n cmd.env(\"TERM\", \"dumb\").env_remove(\"TZ\");\n let envs: Vec<(&OsStr, Option<&OsStr>)> = cmd.get_envs().collect();\n assert_eq!(envs, &[\n     (OsStr::new(\"TERM\"), Some(OsStr::new(\"dumb\"))),\n     (OsStr::new(\"TZ\"), None)\n ]);\n ```\n"
