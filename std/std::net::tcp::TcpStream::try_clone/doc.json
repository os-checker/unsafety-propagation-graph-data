Both handles will read and write the same stream of\n data, and options set on one stream will be propagated to the other\n stream.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::TcpStream;\n\n let stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")\n                        .expect(\"Couldn't connect to the server...\");\n let stream_clone = stream.try_clone().expect(\"clone failed...\");\n ```\n"
