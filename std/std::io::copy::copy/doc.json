  "doc": " Copies the entire contents of a reader into a writer.\n\n This function will continuously read data from `reader` and then\n write it into `writer` in a streaming fashion until `reader`\n returns EOF.\n\n On success, the total number of bytes that were copied from\n `reader` to `writer` is returned.\n\n If you want to copy the contents of one file to another and you’re\n working with filesystem paths, see the [`fs::copy`] function.\n\n [`fs::copy`]: crate::fs::copy\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error immediately if any call to [`read`] or\n [`write`] returns an error. All instances of [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] are\n handled by this function and the underlying operation is retried.\n\n [`read`]: Read::read\n [`write`]: Write::write\n [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`]: crate::io::ErrorKind::Interrupted\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::io;\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut reader: &[u8] = b\"hello\";\n     let mut writer: Vec<u8> = vec![];\n\n     io::copy(&mut reader, &mut writer)?;\n\n     assert_eq!(&b\"hello\"[..], &writer[..]);\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n On Linux (including Android), this function uses `copy_file_range(2)`,\n `sendfile(2)` or `splice(2)` syscalls to move data directly between file\n descriptors if possible.\n\n Note that platform-specific behavior [may change in the future][changes].\n\n [changes]: crate::io#platform-specific-behavior\n"
