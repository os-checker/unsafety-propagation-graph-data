  "doc": " Removes a directory at this path, after removing all its contents. Use\n carefully!\n\n This function does **not** follow symbolic links and it will simply remove the\n symbolic link itself.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n These implementation details [may change in the future][changes].\n\n - \"Unix-like\": By default, this function currently corresponds to\n `openat`, `fdopendir`, `unlinkat` and `lstat`\n on Unix-family platforms, except where noted otherwise.\n - \"Windows\": This function currently corresponds to `CreateFileW`,\n `GetFileInformationByHandleEx`, `SetFileInformationByHandle`, and `NtCreateFile`.\n\n ## Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions\n See the [module-level TOCTOU explanation](self#time-of-check-to-time-of-use-toctou).\n\n On most platforms, `fs::remove_dir_all` protects against symlink TOCTOU races by default.\n However, on the following platforms, this protection is not provided and the function should\n not be used in security-sensitive contexts:\n - **Miri**: Even when emulating targets where the underlying implementation will protect against\n   TOCTOU races, Miri will not do so.\n - **Redox OS**: This function does not protect against TOCTOU races, as Redox does not implement\n   the required platform support to do so.\n\n [TOCTOU]: self#time-of-check-to-time-of-use-toctou\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n See [`fs::remove_file`] and [`fs::remove_dir`].\n\n [`remove_dir_all`] will fail if [`remove_dir`] or [`remove_file`] fail on *any* constituent\n paths, *including* the root `path`. Consequently,\n\n - The directory you are deleting *must* exist, meaning that this function is *not idempotent*.\n - [`remove_dir_all`] will fail if the `path` is *not* a directory.\n\n Consider ignoring the error if validating the removal is not required for your use case.\n\n This function may return [`io::ErrorKind::DirectoryNotEmpty`] if the directory is concurrently\n written into, which typically indicates some contents were removed but not all.\n [`io::ErrorKind::NotFound`] is only returned if no removal occurs.\n\n [`fs::remove_file`]: remove_file\n [`fs::remove_dir`]: remove_dir\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::remove_dir_all(\"/some/dir\")?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
