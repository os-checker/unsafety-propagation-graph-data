  "doc": " Searches for an element of an iterator that satisfies a predicate.\n\n `find()` takes a closure that returns `true` or `false`. It applies\n this closure to each element of the iterator, and if any of them return\n `true`, then `find()` returns [`Some(element)`]. If they all return\n `false`, it returns [`None`].\n\n `find()` is short-circuiting; in other words, it will stop processing\n as soon as the closure returns `true`.\n\n Because `find()` takes a reference, and many iterators iterate over\n references, this leads to a possibly confusing situation where the\n argument is a double reference. You can see this effect in the\n examples below, with `&&x`.\n\n If you need the index of the element, see [`position()`].\n\n [`Some(element)`]: Some\n [`position()`]: Iterator::position\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n assert_eq!(a.into_iter().find(|&x| x == 2), Some(2));\n assert_eq!(a.into_iter().find(|&x| x == 5), None);\n ```\n\n Stopping at the first `true`:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter();\n\n assert_eq!(iter.find(|&x| x == 2), Some(2));\n\n // we can still use `iter`, as there are more elements.\n assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(3));\n ```\n\n Note that `iter.find(f)` is equivalent to `iter.filter(f).next()`.\n"
