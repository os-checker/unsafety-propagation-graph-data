  "doc": " Compute the distance between the origin and a point (`x`, `y`) on the\n Euclidean plane. Equivalently, compute the length of the hypotenuse of a\n right-angle triangle with other sides having length `x.abs()` and\n `y.abs()`.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `hypotf128` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f128_math)] {\n\n let x = 2.0f128;\n let y = 3.0f128;\n\n // sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\n let abs_difference = (x.hypot(y) - (x.powi(2) + y.powi(2)).sqrt()).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
