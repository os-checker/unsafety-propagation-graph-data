  "doc": " Sets the mode bits that a new file will be created with.\n\n If a new file is created as part of an `OpenOptions::open` call then this\n specified `mode` will be used as the permission bits for the new file.\n If no `mode` is set, the default of `0o666` will be used.\n The operating system masks out bits with the system's `umask`, to produce\n the final permissions.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::OpenOptions;\n use std::os::unix::fs::OpenOptionsExt;\n\n # fn main() {\n let mut options = OpenOptions::new();\n options.mode(0o644); // Give read/write for owner and read for others.\n let file = options.open(\"foo.txt\");\n # }\n ```\n"
