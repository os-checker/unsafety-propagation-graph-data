The lock is released after\n the closure completes, even if it panics.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(lock_value_accessors, nonpoison_rwlock)]\n\n use std::sync::nonpoison::RwLock;\n\n let rwlock = RwLock::new(2);\n\n let result = rwlock.with_mut(|data| {\n     *data += 3;\n\n     *data + 5\n });\n\n assert_eq!(*rwlock.read(), 5);\n assert_eq!(result, 10);\n ```\n"
