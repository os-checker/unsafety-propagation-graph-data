  "doc": " Uses [`sleep`].\n\n Puts the current thread to sleep for at least the specified amount of time.\n\n The thread may sleep longer than the duration specified due to scheduling\n specifics or platform-dependent functionality. It will never sleep less.\n\n This function is blocking, and should not be used in `async` functions.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n On Unix platforms, the underlying syscall may be interrupted by a\n spurious wakeup or signal handler. To ensure the sleep occurs for at least\n the specified duration, this function may invoke that system call multiple\n times.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::thread;\n\n // Let's sleep for 2 seconds:\n thread::sleep_ms(2000);\n ```\n"
