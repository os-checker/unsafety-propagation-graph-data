  "doc": " Parses this string slice into another type.\n\n Because `parse` is so general, it can cause problems with type\n inference. As such, `parse` is one of the few times you'll see\n the syntax affectionately known as the 'turbofish': `::<>`. This\n helps the inference algorithm understand specifically which type\n you're trying to parse into.\n\n `parse` can parse into any type that implements the [`FromStr`] trait.\n\n # Errors\n\n Will return [`Err`] if it's not possible to parse this string slice into\n the desired type.\n\n [`Err`]: FromStr::Err\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let four: u32 = \"4\".parse().unwrap();\n\n assert_eq!(4, four);\n ```\n\n Using the 'turbofish' instead of annotating `four`:\n\n ```\n let four = \"4\".parse::<u32>();\n\n assert_eq!(Ok(4), four);\n ```\n\n Failing to parse:\n\n ```\n let nope = \"j\".parse::<u32>();\n\n assert!(nope.is_err());\n ```\n"
