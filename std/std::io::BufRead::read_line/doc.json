  "doc": " Reads all bytes until a newline (the `0xA` byte) is reached, and append\n them to the provided `String` buffer.\n\n Previous content of the buffer will be preserved. To avoid appending to\n the buffer, you need to [`clear`] it first.\n\n This function will read bytes from the underlying stream until the\n newline delimiter (the `0xA` byte) or EOF is found. Once found, all bytes\n up to, and including, the delimiter (if found) will be appended to\n `buf`.\n\n If successful, this function will return the total number of bytes read.\n\n If this function returns [`Ok(0)`], the stream has reached EOF.\n\n This function is blocking and should be used carefully: it is possible for\n an attacker to continuously send bytes without ever sending a newline\n or EOF. You can use [`take`] to limit the maximum number of bytes read.\n\n [`Ok(0)`]: Ok\n [`clear`]: String::clear\n [`take`]: crate::io::Read::take\n\n # Errors\n\n This function has the same error semantics as [`read_until`] and will\n also return an error if the read bytes are not valid UTF-8. If an I/O\n error is encountered then `buf` may contain some bytes already read in\n the event that all data read so far was valid UTF-8.\n\n [`read_until`]: BufRead::read_until\n\n # Examples\n\n [`std::io::Cursor`][`Cursor`] is a type that implements `BufRead`. In\n this example, we use [`Cursor`] to read all the lines in a byte slice:\n\n ```\n use std::io::{self, BufRead};\n\n let mut cursor = io::Cursor::new(b\"foo\\nbar\");\n let mut buf = String::new();\n\n // cursor is at 'f'\n let num_bytes = cursor.read_line(&mut buf)\n     .expect(\"reading from cursor won't fail\");\n assert_eq!(num_bytes, 4);\n assert_eq!(buf, \"foo\\n\");\n buf.clear();\n\n // cursor is at 'b'\n let num_bytes = cursor.read_line(&mut buf)\n     .expect(\"reading from cursor won't fail\");\n assert_eq!(num_bytes, 3);\n assert_eq!(buf, \"bar\");\n buf.clear();\n\n // cursor is at EOF\n let num_bytes = cursor.read_line(&mut buf)\n     .expect(\"reading from cursor won't fail\");\n assert_eq!(num_bytes, 0);\n assert_eq!(buf, \"\");\n ```\n"
