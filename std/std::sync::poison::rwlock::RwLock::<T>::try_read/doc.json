  "doc": " Attempts to acquire this `RwLock` with shared read access.\n\n If the access could not be granted at this time, then `Err` is returned.\n Otherwise, an RAII guard is returned which will release the shared access\n when it is dropped.\n\n This function does not block.\n\n This function does not provide any guarantees with respect to the ordering\n of whether contentious readers or writers will acquire the lock first.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return the [`Poisoned`] error if the `RwLock` is\n poisoned. An `RwLock` is poisoned whenever a writer panics while holding\n an exclusive lock. `Poisoned` will only be returned if the lock would\n have otherwise been acquired. An acquired lock guard will be contained\n in the returned error.\n\n This function will return the [`WouldBlock`] error if the `RwLock` could\n not be acquired because it was already locked exclusively.\n\n [`Poisoned`]: TryLockError::Poisoned\n [`WouldBlock`]: TryLockError::WouldBlock\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::RwLock;\n\n let lock = RwLock::new(1);\n\n match lock.try_read() {\n     Ok(n) => assert_eq!(*n, 1),\n     Err(_) => unreachable!(),\n };\n ```\n"
