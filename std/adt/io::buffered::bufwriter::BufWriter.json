  "doc_adt": " Wraps a writer and buffers its output.\n\n It can be excessively inefficient to work directly with something that\n implements [`Write`]. For example, every call to\n [`write`][`TcpStream::write`] on [`TcpStream`] results in a system call. A\n `BufWriter<W>` keeps an in-memory buffer of data and writes it to an underlying\n writer in large, infrequent batches.\n\n `BufWriter<W>` can improve the speed of programs that make *small* and\n *repeated* write calls to the same file or network socket. It does not\n help when writing very large amounts at once, or writing just one or a few\n times. It also provides no advantage when writing to a destination that is\n in memory, like a <code>[Vec]\\<u8></code>.\n\n It is critical to call [`flush`] before `BufWriter<W>` is dropped. Though\n dropping will attempt to flush the contents of the buffer, any errors\n that happen in the process of dropping will be ignored. Calling [`flush`]\n ensures that the buffer is empty and thus dropping will not even attempt\n file operations.\n\n # Examples\n\n Let's write the numbers one through ten to a [`TcpStream`]:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::net::TcpStream;\n\n let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").unwrap();\n\n for i in 0..10 {\n     stream.write(&[i+1]).unwrap();\n }\n ```\n\n Because we're not buffering, we write each one in turn, incurring the\n overhead of a system call per byte written. We can fix this with a\n `BufWriter<W>`:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::io::BufWriter;\n use std::net::TcpStream;\n\n let mut stream = BufWriter::new(TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").unwrap());\n\n for i in 0..10 {\n     stream.write(&[i+1]).unwrap();\n }\n stream.flush().unwrap();\n ```\n\n By wrapping the stream with a `BufWriter<W>`, these ten writes are all grouped\n together by the buffer and will all be written out in one system call when\n the `stream` is flushed.\n\n [`TcpStream::write`]: crate::net::TcpStream::write\n [`TcpStream`]: crate::net::TcpStream\n [`flush`]: BufWriter::flush\n",
