  "doc_adt": " This type represents the status code the current process can return\n to its parent under normal termination.\n\n `ExitCode` is intended to be consumed only by the standard library (via\n [`Termination::report()`]). For forwards compatibility with potentially\n unusual targets, this type currently does not provide `Eq`, `Hash`, or\n access to the raw value. This type does provide `PartialEq` for\n comparison, but note that there may potentially be multiple failure\n codes, some of which will _not_ compare equal to `ExitCode::FAILURE`.\n The standard library provides the canonical `SUCCESS` and `FAILURE`\n exit codes as well as `From<u8> for ExitCode` for constructing other\n arbitrary exit codes.\n\n # Portability\n\n Numeric values used in this type don't have portable meanings, and\n different platforms may mask different amounts of them.\n\n For the platform's canonical successful and unsuccessful codes, see\n the [`SUCCESS`] and [`FAILURE`] associated items.\n\n [`SUCCESS`]: ExitCode::SUCCESS\n [`FAILURE`]: ExitCode::FAILURE\n\n # Differences from `ExitStatus`\n\n `ExitCode` is intended for terminating the currently running process, via\n the `Termination` trait, in contrast to [`ExitStatus`], which represents the\n termination of a child process. These APIs are separate due to platform\n compatibility differences and their expected usage; it is not generally\n possible to exactly reproduce an `ExitStatus` from a child for the current\n process after the fact.\n\n # Examples\n\n `ExitCode` can be returned from the `main` function of a crate, as it implements\n [`Termination`]:\n\n ```\n use std::process::ExitCode;\n # fn check_foo() -> bool { true }\n\n fn main() -> ExitCode {\n     if !check_foo() {\n         return ExitCode::from(42);\n     }\n\n     ExitCode::SUCCESS\n }\n ```\n",
