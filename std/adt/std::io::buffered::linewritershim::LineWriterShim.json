In this way, a more\n efficient abstraction can be created than one that only had access to\n `write` and `flush`, without needlessly duplicating a lot of the\n implementation details of BufWriter. This also allows existing\n `BufWriters` to be temporarily given line-buffering logic; this is what\n enables Stdout to be alternately in line-buffered or block-buffered mode.\n",
