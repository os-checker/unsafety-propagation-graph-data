A `ThreadId`\n can be retrieved from the [`id`] method on a [`Thread`].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::thread;\n\n let other_thread = thread::spawn(|| {\n     thread::current().id()\n });\n\n let other_thread_id = other_thread.join().unwrap();\n assert!(thread::current().id() != other_thread_id);\n ```\n\n [`Thread`]: super::Thread\n [`id`]: super::Thread::id\n",
