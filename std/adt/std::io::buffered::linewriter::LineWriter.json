  "doc_adt": " Wraps a writer and buffers output to it, flushing whenever a newline\n (`0x0a`, `'\\n'`) is detected.\n\n The [`BufWriter`] struct wraps a writer and buffers its output.\n But it only does this batched write when it goes out of scope, or when the\n internal buffer is full. Sometimes, you'd prefer to write each line as it's\n completed, rather than the entire buffer at once. Enter `LineWriter`. It\n does exactly that.\n\n Like [`BufWriter`], a `LineWriter`’s buffer will also be flushed when the\n `LineWriter` goes out of scope or when its internal buffer is full.\n\n If there's still a partial line in the buffer when the `LineWriter` is\n dropped, it will flush those contents.\n\n # Examples\n\n We can use `LineWriter` to write one line at a time, significantly\n reducing the number of actual writes to the file.\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::{self, File};\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::io::LineWriter;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let road_not_taken = b\"I shall be telling this with a sigh\n Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -\n I took the one less traveled by,\n And that has made all the difference.\";\n\n     let file = File::create(\"poem.txt\")?;\n     let mut file = LineWriter::new(file);\n\n     file.write_all(b\"I shall be telling this with a sigh\")?;\n\n     // No bytes are written until a newline is encountered (or\n     // the internal buffer is filled).\n     assert_eq!(fs::read_to_string(\"poem.txt\")?, \"\");\n     file.write_all(b\"\\n\")?;\n     assert_eq!(\n         fs::read_to_string(\"poem.txt\")?,\n         \"I shall be telling this with a sigh\\n\",\n     );\n\n     // Write the rest of the poem.\n     file.write_all(b\"Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -\n I took the one less traveled by,\n And that has made all the difference.\")?;\n\n     // The last line of the poem doesn't end in a newline, so\n     // we have to flush or drop the `LineWriter` to finish\n     // writing.\n     file.flush()?;\n\n     // Confirm the whole poem was written.\n     assert_eq!(fs::read(\"poem.txt\")?, &road_not_taken[..]);\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n",
