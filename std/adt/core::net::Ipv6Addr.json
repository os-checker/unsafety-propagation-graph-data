  "doc_adt": " An IPv6 address.\n\n IPv6 addresses are defined as 128-bit integers in [IETF RFC 4291].\n They are usually represented as eight 16-bit segments.\n\n [IETF RFC 4291]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291\n\n # Embedding IPv4 Addresses\n\n See [`IpAddr`] for a type encompassing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\n To assist in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 two types of IPv6 addresses that embed an IPv4 address were defined:\n IPv4-compatible and IPv4-mapped addresses. Of these IPv4-compatible addresses have been officially deprecated.\n\n Both types of addresses are not assigned any special meaning by this implementation,\n other than what the relevant standards prescribe. This means that an address like `::ffff:127.0.0.1`,\n while representing an IPv4 loopback address, is not itself an IPv6 loopback address; only `::1` is.\n To handle these so called \"IPv4-in-IPv6\" addresses, they have to first be converted to their canonical IPv4 address.\n\n ### IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Addresses\n\n IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses are defined in [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.1], and have been officially deprecated.\n The RFC describes the format of an \"IPv4-Compatible IPv6 address\" as follows:\n\n ```text\n |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |\n +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+\n |0000..............................0000|0000|    IPv4 address     |\n +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+\n ```\n So `::a.b.c.d` would be an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address representing the IPv4 address `a.b.c.d`.\n\n To convert from an IPv4 address to an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address, use [`Ipv4Addr::to_ipv6_compatible`].\n Use [`Ipv6Addr::to_ipv4`] to convert an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address to the canonical IPv4 address.\n\n [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.1\n\n ### IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Addresses\n\n IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are defined in [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.2].\n The RFC describes the format of an \"IPv4-Mapped IPv6 address\" as follows:\n\n ```text\n |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |\n +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+\n |0000..............................0000|FFFF|    IPv4 address     |\n +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+\n ```\n So `::ffff:a.b.c.d` would be an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address representing the IPv4 address `a.b.c.d`.\n\n To convert from an IPv4 address to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, use [`Ipv4Addr::to_ipv6_mapped`].\n Use [`Ipv6Addr::to_ipv4`] to convert an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address to the canonical IPv4 address.\n Note that this will also convert the IPv6 loopback address `::1` to `0.0.0.1`. Use\n [`Ipv6Addr::to_ipv4_mapped`] to avoid this.\n\n [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.2]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.2\n\n # Textual representation\n\n `Ipv6Addr` provides a [`FromStr`] implementation. There are many ways to represent\n an IPv6 address in text, but in general, each segments is written in hexadecimal\n notation, and segments are separated by `:`. For more information, see\n [IETF RFC 5952].\n\n [`FromStr`]: crate::str::FromStr\n [IETF RFC 5952]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::net::Ipv6Addr;\n\n let localhost = Ipv6Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1);\n assert_eq!(\"::1\".parse(), Ok(localhost));\n assert_eq!(localhost.is_loopback(), true);\n ```\n",
