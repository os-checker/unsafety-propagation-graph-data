  "doc_adt": " A locked reference to the [`Stdout`] handle.\n\n This handle implements the [`Write`] trait, and is constructed via\n the [`Stdout::lock`] method. See its documentation for more.\n\n By default, the handle is line-buffered when connected to a terminal, meaning\n it flushes automatically when a newline (`\\n`) is encountered. For immediate\n output, you can manually call the [`flush`] method. When the handle goes out\n of scope, the buffer is automatically flushed.\n\n ### Note: Windows Portability Considerations\n\n When operating in a console, the Windows implementation of this stream does not support\n non-UTF-8 byte sequences. Attempting to write bytes that are not valid UTF-8 will return\n an error.\n\n In a process with a detached console, such as one using\n `#![windows_subsystem = \"windows\"]`, or in a child process spawned from such a process,\n the contained handle will be null. In such cases, the standard library's `Read` and\n `Write` will do nothing and silently succeed. All other I/O operations, via the\n standard library or via raw Windows API calls, will fail.\n\n [`flush`]: Write::flush\n",
