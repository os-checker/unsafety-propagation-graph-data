  "doc_adt": " Options and flags which can be used to configure how a file is opened.\n\n This builder exposes the ability to configure how a [`File`] is opened and\n what operations are permitted on the open file. The [`File::open`] and\n [`File::create`] methods are aliases for commonly used options using this\n builder.\n\n Generally speaking, when using `OpenOptions`, you'll first call\n [`OpenOptions::new`], then chain calls to methods to set each option, then\n call [`OpenOptions::open`], passing the path of the file you're trying to\n open. This will give you a [`io::Result`] with a [`File`] inside that you\n can further operate on.\n\n # Examples\n\n Opening a file to read:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::OpenOptions;\n\n let file = OpenOptions::new().read(true).open(\"foo.txt\");\n ```\n\n Opening a file for both reading and writing, as well as creating it if it\n doesn't exist:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::OpenOptions;\n\n let file = OpenOptions::new()\n             .read(true)\n             .write(true)\n             .create(true)\n             .open(\"foo.txt\");\n ```\n",
