  "doc_adt": " A wrapper for `&[u8]` representing a human-readable string that's conventionally, but not\n always, UTF-8.\n\n Unlike `&str`, this type permits non-UTF-8 contents, making it suitable for user input,\n non-native filenames (as `Path` only supports native filenames), and other applications that\n need to round-trip whatever data the user provides.\n\n For an owned, growable byte string buffer, use\n [`ByteString`](../../std/bstr/struct.ByteString.html).\n\n `ByteStr` implements `Deref` to `[u8]`, so all methods available on `[u8]` are available on\n `ByteStr`.\n\n # Representation\n\n A `&ByteStr` has the same representation as a `&str`. That is, a `&ByteStr` is a wide pointer\n which includes a pointer to some bytes and a length.\n\n # Trait implementations\n\n The `ByteStr` type has a number of trait implementations, and in particular, defines equality\n and comparisons between `&ByteStr`, `&str`, and `&[u8]`, for convenience.\n\n The `Debug` implementation for `ByteStr` shows its bytes as a normal string, with invalid UTF-8\n presented as hex escape sequences.\n\n The `Display` implementation behaves as if the `ByteStr` were first lossily converted to a\n `str`, with invalid UTF-8 presented as the Unicode replacement character (�).\n",
