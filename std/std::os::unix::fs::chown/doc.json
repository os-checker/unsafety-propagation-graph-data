  "doc": " Change the owner and group of the specified path.\n\n Specifying either the uid or gid as `None` will leave it unchanged.\n\n Changing the owner typically requires privileges, such as root or a specific capability.\n Changing the group typically requires either being the owner and a member of the group, or\n having privileges.\n\n Be aware that changing owner clears the `suid` and `sgid` permission bits in most cases\n according to POSIX, usually even if the user is root. The sgid is not cleared when\n the file is non-group-executable. See: <https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chown.2.html>\n This call may also clear file capabilities, if there was any.\n\n If called on a symbolic link, this will change the owner and group of the link target. To\n change the owner and group of the link itself, see [`lchown`].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::os::unix::fs;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     fs::chown(\"/sandbox\", Some(0), Some(0))?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
