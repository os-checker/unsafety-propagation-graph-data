  "doc": " Parses input according to platform conventions for the `PATH`\n environment variable.\n\n Returns an iterator over the paths contained in `unparsed`. The iterator\n element type is [`PathBuf`].\n\n On most Unix platforms, the separator is `:` and on Windows it is `;`. This\n also performs unquoting on Windows.\n\n [`join_paths`] can be used to recombine elements.\n\n # Panics\n\n This will panic on systems where there is no delimited `PATH` variable,\n such as UEFI.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::env;\n\n let key = \"PATH\";\n match env::var_os(key) {\n     Some(paths) => {\n         for path in env::split_paths(&paths) {\n             println!(\"'{}'\", path.display());\n         }\n     }\n     None => println!(\"{key} is not defined in the environment.\")\n }\n ```\n"
