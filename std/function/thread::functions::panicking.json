  "doc": " Determines whether the current thread is unwinding because of panic.\n\n A common use of this feature is to poison shared resources when writing\n unsafe code, by checking `panicking` when the `drop` is called.\n\n This is usually not needed when writing safe code, as [`Mutex`es][Mutex]\n already poison themselves when a thread panics while holding the lock.\n\n This can also be used in multithreaded applications, in order to send a\n message to other threads warning that a thread has panicked (e.g., for\n monitoring purposes).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```should_panic\n use std::thread;\n\n struct SomeStruct;\n\n impl Drop for SomeStruct {\n     fn drop(&mut self) {\n         if thread::panicking() {\n             println!(\"dropped while unwinding\");\n         } else {\n             println!(\"dropped while not unwinding\");\n         }\n     }\n }\n\n {\n     print!(\"a: \");\n     let a = SomeStruct;\n }\n\n {\n     print!(\"b: \");\n     let b = SomeStruct;\n     panic!()\n }\n ```\n\n [Mutex]: crate::sync::Mutex\n",
