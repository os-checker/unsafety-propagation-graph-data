      "doc": " Terminates the process in an abnormal fashion.\n\n The function will never return and will immediately terminate the current\n process in a platform specific \"abnormal\" manner. As a consequence,\n no destructors on the current stack or any other thread's stack\n will be run, Rust IO buffers (eg, from `BufWriter`) will not be flushed,\n and C stdio buffers will (on most platforms) not be flushed.\n\n This is in contrast to the default behavior of [`panic!`] which unwinds\n the current thread's stack and calls all destructors.\n When `panic=\"abort\"` is set, either as an argument to `rustc` or in a\n crate's Cargo.toml, [`panic!`] and `abort` are similar. However,\n [`panic!`] will still call the [panic hook] while `abort` will not.\n\n If a clean shutdown is needed it is recommended to only call\n this function at a known point where there are no more destructors left\n to run.\n\n The process's termination will be similar to that from the C `abort()`\n function.  On Unix, the process will terminate with signal `SIGABRT`, which\n typically means that the shell prints \"Aborted\".\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process;\n\n fn main() {\n     println!(\"aborting\");\n\n     process::abort();\n\n     // execution never gets here\n }\n ```\n\n The `abort` function terminates the process, so the destructor will not\n get run on the example below:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process;\n\n struct HasDrop;\n\n impl Drop for HasDrop {\n     fn drop(&mut self) {\n         println!(\"This will never be printed!\");\n     }\n }\n\n fn main() {\n     let _x = HasDrop;\n     process::abort();\n     // the destructor implemented for HasDrop will never get run\n }\n ```\n\n [panic hook]: crate::panic::set_hook\n",
