This method will not return until all buffers have\n been successfully written or such an error occurs. The first error that\n is not of [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] kind generated from this method\n will be returned.\n\n If the buffer contains no data, this will never call [`write_vectored`].\n\n # Notes\n\n Unlike [`write_vectored`], this takes a *mutable* reference to\n a slice of [`IoSlice`]s, not an immutable one. That's because we need to\n modify the slice to keep track of the bytes already written.\n\n Once this function returns, the contents of `bufs` are unspecified, as\n this depends on how many calls to [`write_vectored`] were necessary. It is\n best to understand this function as taking ownership of `bufs` and to\n not use `bufs` afterwards. The underlying buffers, to which the\n [`IoSlice`]s point (but not the [`IoSlice`]s themselves), are unchanged and\n can be reused.\n\n [`write_vectored`]: Write::write_vectored\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(write_all_vectored)]\n # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n\n use std::io::{Write, IoSlice};\n\n let mut writer = Vec::new();\n let bufs = &mut [\n     IoSlice::new(&[1]),\n     IoSlice::new(&[2, 3]),\n     IoSlice::new(&[4, 5, 6]),\n ];\n\n writer.write_all_vectored(bufs)?;\n // Note: the contents of `bufs` is now undefined, see the Notes section.\n\n assert_eq!(writer, &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);\n # Ok(()) }\n ```\n",
