      "doc": " Writes a buffer into this writer, returning how many bytes were written.\n\n This function will attempt to write the entire contents of `buf`, but\n the entire write might not succeed, or the write may also generate an\n error. Typically, a call to `write` represents one attempt to write to\n any wrapped object.\n\n Calls to `write` are not guaranteed to block waiting for data to be\n written, and a write which would otherwise block can be indicated through\n an [`Err`] variant.\n\n If this method consumed `n > 0` bytes of `buf` it must return [`Ok(n)`].\n If the return value is `Ok(n)` then `n` must satisfy `n <= buf.len()`.\n A return value of `Ok(0)` typically means that the underlying object is\n no longer able to accept bytes and will likely not be able to in the\n future as well, or that the buffer provided is empty.\n\n # Errors\n\n Each call to `write` may generate an I/O error indicating that the\n operation could not be completed. If an error is returned then no bytes\n in the buffer were written to this writer.\n\n It is **not** considered an error if the entire buffer could not be\n written to this writer.\n\n An error of the [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] kind is non-fatal and the\n write operation should be retried if there is nothing else to do.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n use std::fs::File;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let mut buffer = File::create(\"foo.txt\")?;\n\n     // Writes some prefix of the byte string, not necessarily all of it.\n     buffer.write(b\"some bytes\")?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n\n [`Ok(n)`]: Ok\n",
