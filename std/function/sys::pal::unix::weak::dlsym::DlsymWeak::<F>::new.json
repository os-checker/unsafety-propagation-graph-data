For example, the following code will cause undefined\n behavior when `ptr` is used inside the `unsafe` block:\n\n ```no_run\n # #![expect(dangling_pointers_from_temporaries)]\n use std::ffi::{CStr, CString};\n\n // 💀 The meaning of this entire program is undefined,\n // 💀 and nothing about its behavior is guaranteed,\n // 💀 not even that its behavior resembles the code as written,\n // 💀 just because it contains a single instance of undefined behavior!\n\n // 🚨 creates a dangling pointer to a temporary `CString`\n // 🚨 that is deallocated at the end of the statement\n let ptr = CString::new(\"Hi!\".to_uppercase()).unwrap().as_ptr();\n\n // without undefined behavior, you would expect that `ptr` equals:\n dbg!(CStr::from_bytes_with_nul(b\"HI!\\0\").unwrap());\n\n // 🙏 Possibly the program behaved as expected so far,\n // 🙏 and this just shows `ptr` is now garbage..., but\n // 💀 this violates `CStr::from_ptr`'s safety contract\n // 💀 leading to a dereference of a dangling pointer,\n // 💀 which is immediate undefined behavior.\n // 💀 *BOOM*, you're dead, your entire program has no meaning.\n dbg!(unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(ptr) });\n ```\n\n This happens because, the pointer returned by `as_ptr` does not carry any\n lifetime information, and the `CString` is deallocated immediately after\n the expression that it is part of has been evaluated.\n To fix the problem, bind the `CString` to a local variable:\n\n ```\n use std::ffi::{CStr, CString};\n\n let c_str = CString::new(\"Hi!\".to_uppercase()).unwrap();\n let ptr = c_str.as_ptr();\n\n assert_eq!(unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(ptr) }, c\"HI!\");\n ```\n",
