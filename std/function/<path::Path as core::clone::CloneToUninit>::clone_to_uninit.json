(For example, it might panic if memory allocation for a clone\n of a value owned by `self` fails.)\n If the call panics, then `*dest` should be treated as uninitialized memory; it must not be\n read or dropped, because even if it was previously valid, it may have been partially\n overwritten.\n\n The caller may wish to take care to deallocate the allocation pointed to by `dest`,\n if applicable, to avoid a memory leak (but this is not a requirement).\n\n Implementors should avoid leaking values by, upon unwinding, dropping all component values\n that might have already been created. (For example, if a `[Foo]` of length 3 is being\n cloned, and the second of the three calls to `Foo::clone()` unwinds, then the first `Foo`\n cloned should be dropped.)\n",
