The join handle can be used to block on\n termination of the spawned thread, including recovering its panics.\n\n This method is identical to [`thread::Builder::spawn`][`Builder::spawn`],\n except for the relaxed lifetime bounds, which render it unsafe.\n For a more complete documentation see [`thread::spawn`].\n\n # Errors\n\n Unlike the [`spawn`] free function, this method yields an\n [`io::Result`] to capture any failure to create the thread at\n the OS level.\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if a thread name was set and it contained null bytes.\n\n # Safety\n\n The caller has to ensure that the spawned thread does not outlive any\n references in the supplied thread closure and its return type.\n This can be guaranteed in two ways:\n\n - ensure that [`join`][`JoinHandle::join`] is called before any referenced\n data is dropped\n - use only types with `'static` lifetime bounds, i.e., those with no or only\n `'static` references (both [`thread::Builder::spawn`][`Builder::spawn`]\n and [`thread::spawn`] enforce this property statically)\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::thread;\n\n let builder = thread::Builder::new();\n\n let x = 1;\n let thread_x = &x;\n\n let handler = unsafe {\n     builder.spawn_unchecked(move || {\n         println!(\"x = {}\", *thread_x);\n     }).unwrap()\n };\n\n // caller has to ensure `join()` is called, otherwise\n // it is possible to access freed memory if `x` gets\n // dropped before the thread closure is executed!\n handler.join().unwrap();\n ```\n\n [`io::Result`]: crate::io::Result\n [`thread::spawn`]: super::spawn\n [`spawn`]: super::spawn\n",
