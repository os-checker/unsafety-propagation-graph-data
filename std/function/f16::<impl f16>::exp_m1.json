This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `expm1f` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f16)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f16_math)] {\n\n let x = 1e-4_f16;\n\n // for very small x, e^x is approximately 1 + x + x^2 / 2\n let approx = x + x * x / 2.0;\n let abs_difference = (x.exp_m1() - approx).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference < 1e-4);\n # }\n ```\n",
