Calling this when the content is not yet fully\n initialized causes undefined behavior.\n\n On top of that, all additional invariants of the type `T` must be\n satisfied, as the `Drop` implementation of `T` (or its members) may\n rely on this. For example, setting a `Vec<T>` to an invalid but\n non-null address makes it initialized (under the current implementation;\n this does not constitute a stable guarantee), because the only\n requirement the compiler knows about it is that the data pointer must be\n non-null. Dropping such a `Vec<T>` however will cause undefined\n behavior.\n\n [`assume_init`]: MaybeUninit::assume_init\n",
