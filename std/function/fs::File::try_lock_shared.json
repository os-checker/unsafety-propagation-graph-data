  "doc": " Try to acquire a shared (non-exclusive) lock on the file.\n\n Returns `Err(TryLockError::WouldBlock)` if a different lock is already held on this file\n (via another handle/descriptor).\n\n This acquires a shared lock; more than one file handle may hold a shared lock, but none may\n hold an exclusive lock at the same time.\n\n This lock may be advisory or mandatory. This lock is meant to interact with [`lock`],\n [`try_lock`], [`lock_shared`], [`try_lock_shared`], and [`unlock`]. Its interactions with\n other methods, such as [`read`] and [`write`] are platform specific, and it may or may not\n cause non-lockholders to block.\n\n If this file handle, or a clone of it, already holds a lock, the exact behavior is\n unspecified and platform dependent, including the possibility that it will deadlock.\n However, if this method returns `Ok(())`, then it has acquired a shared lock.\n\n The lock will be released when this file (along with any other file descriptors/handles\n duplicated or inherited from it) is closed, or if the [`unlock`] method is called.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `flock` function on Unix with the `LOCK_SH` and\n `LOCK_NB` flags, and the `LockFileEx` function on Windows with the\n `LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY` flag. Note that, this\n [may change in the future][changes].\n\n On Windows, locking a file will fail if the file is opened only for append. To lock a file,\n open it with one of `.read(true)`, `.read(true).append(true)`, or `.write(true)`.\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n [`lock`]: File::lock\n [`lock_shared`]: File::lock_shared\n [`try_lock`]: File::try_lock\n [`try_lock_shared`]: File::try_lock_shared\n [`unlock`]: File::unlock\n [`read`]: Read::read\n [`write`]: Write::write\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::{File, TryLockError};\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let f = File::open(\"foo.txt\")?;\n     // Explicit handling of the WouldBlock error\n     match f.try_lock_shared() {\n         Ok(_) => (),\n         Err(TryLockError::WouldBlock) => (), // Lock not acquired\n         Err(TryLockError::Error(err)) => return Err(err),\n     }\n     // Alternately, propagate the error as an io::Error\n     f.try_lock_shared()?;\n\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n",
