  "doc": " Returns the length of this stream (in bytes).\n\n The default implementation uses up to three seek operations. If this\n method returns successfully, the seek position is unchanged (i.e. the\n position before calling this method is the same as afterwards).\n However, if this method returns an error, the seek position is\n unspecified.\n\n If you need to obtain the length of *many* streams and you don't care\n about the seek position afterwards, you can reduce the number of seek\n operations by simply calling `seek(SeekFrom::End(0))` and using its\n return value (it is also the stream length).\n\n Note that length of a stream can change over time (for example, when\n data is appended to a file). So calling this method multiple times does\n not necessarily return the same length each time.\n\n # Example\n\n ```no_run\n #![feature(seek_stream_len)]\n use std::{\n     io::{self, Seek},\n     fs::File,\n };\n\n fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n     let mut f = File::open(\"foo.txt\")?;\n\n     let len = f.stream_len()?;\n     println!(\"The file is currently {len} bytes long\");\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
