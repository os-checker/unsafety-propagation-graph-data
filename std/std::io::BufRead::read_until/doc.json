  "doc": " Reads all bytes into `buf` until the delimiter `byte` or EOF is reached.\n\n This function will read bytes from the underlying stream until the\n delimiter or EOF is found. Once found, all bytes up to, and including,\n the delimiter (if found) will be appended to `buf`.\n\n If successful, this function will return the total number of bytes read.\n\n This function is blocking and should be used carefully: it is possible for\n an attacker to continuously send bytes without ever sending the delimiter\n or EOF.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will ignore all instances of [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] and\n will otherwise return any errors returned by [`fill_buf`].\n\n If an I/O error is encountered then all bytes read so far will be\n present in `buf` and its length will have been adjusted appropriately.\n\n [`fill_buf`]: BufRead::fill_buf\n\n # Examples\n\n [`std::io::Cursor`][`Cursor`] is a type that implements `BufRead`. In\n this example, we use [`Cursor`] to read all the bytes in a byte slice\n in hyphen delimited segments:\n\n ```\n use std::io::{self, BufRead};\n\n let mut cursor = io::Cursor::new(b\"lorem-ipsum\");\n let mut buf = vec![];\n\n // cursor is at 'l'\n let num_bytes = cursor.read_until(b'-', &mut buf)\n     .expect(\"reading from cursor won't fail\");\n assert_eq!(num_bytes, 6);\n assert_eq!(buf, b\"lorem-\");\n buf.clear();\n\n // cursor is at 'i'\n let num_bytes = cursor.read_until(b'-', &mut buf)\n     .expect(\"reading from cursor won't fail\");\n assert_eq!(num_bytes, 5);\n assert_eq!(buf, b\"ipsum\");\n buf.clear();\n\n // cursor is at EOF\n let num_bytes = cursor.read_until(b'-', &mut buf)\n     .expect(\"reading from cursor won't fail\");\n assert_eq!(num_bytes, 0);\n assert_eq!(buf, b\"\");\n ```\n"
