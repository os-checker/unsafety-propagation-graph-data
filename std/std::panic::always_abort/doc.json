  "doc": " Makes all future panics abort directly without running the panic hook or unwinding.\n\n There is no way to undo this; the effect lasts until the process exits or\n execs (or the equivalent).\n\n # Use after fork\n\n This function is particularly useful for calling after `libc::fork`.  After `fork`, in a\n multithreaded program it is (on many platforms) not safe to call the allocator.  It is also\n generally highly undesirable for an unwind to unwind past the `fork`, because that results in\n the unwind propagating to code that was only ever expecting to run in the parent.\n\n `panic::always_abort()` helps avoid both of these.  It directly avoids any further unwinding,\n and if there is a panic, the abort will occur without allocating provided that the arguments to\n panic can be formatted without allocating.\n\n Examples\n\n ```no_run\n #![feature(panic_always_abort)]\n use std::panic;\n\n panic::always_abort();\n\n let _ = panic::catch_unwind(|| {\n     panic!(\"inside the catch\");\n });\n\n // We will have aborted already, due to the panic.\n unreachable!();\n ```\n"
