  "doc": " Returns `true` if some [`call_once()`] call has completed\n successfully. Specifically, `is_completed` will return false in\n the following situations:\n   * [`call_once()`] was not called at all,\n   * [`call_once()`] was called, but has not yet completed,\n   * the [`Once`] instance is poisoned\n\n This function returning `false` does not mean that [`Once`] has not been\n executed. For example, it may have been executed in the time between\n when `is_completed` starts executing and when it returns, in which case\n the `false` return value would be stale (but still permissible).\n\n [`call_once()`]: Once::call_once\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::Once;\n\n static INIT: Once = Once::new();\n\n assert_eq!(INIT.is_completed(), false);\n INIT.call_once(|| {\n     assert_eq!(INIT.is_completed(), false);\n });\n assert_eq!(INIT.is_completed(), true);\n ```\n\n ```\n use std::sync::Once;\n use std::thread;\n\n static INIT: Once = Once::new();\n\n assert_eq!(INIT.is_completed(), false);\n let handle = thread::spawn(|| {\n     INIT.call_once(|| panic!());\n });\n assert!(handle.join().is_err());\n assert_eq!(INIT.is_completed(), false);\n ```\n"
