  "doc": " Removes and returns the element at position `index` within the vector,\n shifting all elements after it to the left.\n\n Note: Because this shifts over the remaining elements, it has a\n worst-case performance of *O*(*n*). If you don't need the order of elements\n to be preserved, use [`swap_remove`] instead. If you'd like to remove\n elements from the beginning of the `Vec`, consider using\n [`VecDeque::pop_front`] instead.\n\n [`swap_remove`]: Vec::swap_remove\n [`VecDeque::pop_front`]: crate::collections::VecDeque::pop_front\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if `index` is out of bounds.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut v = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];\n assert_eq!(v.remove(1), 'b');\n assert_eq!(v, ['a', 'c']);\n ```\n"
