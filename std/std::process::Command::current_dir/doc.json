  "doc": " Sets the working directory for the child process.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n If the program path is relative (e.g., `\"./script.sh\"`), it's ambiguous\n whether it should be interpreted relative to the parent's working\n directory or relative to `current_dir`. The behavior in this case is\n platform specific and unstable, and it's recommended to use\n [`canonicalize`] to get an absolute program path instead.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::process::Command;\n\n Command::new(\"ls\")\n     .current_dir(\"/bin\")\n     .spawn()\n     .expect(\"ls command failed to start\");\n ```\n\n [`canonicalize`]: crate::fs::canonicalize\n"
