  "doc": " Shrinks the capacity of the vector as much as possible.\n\n The behavior of this method depends on the allocator, which may either shrink the vector\n in-place or reallocate. The resulting vector might still have some excess capacity, just as\n is the case for [`with_capacity`]. See [`Allocator::shrink`] for more details.\n\n [`with_capacity`]: Vec::with_capacity\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);\n vec.extend([1, 2, 3]);\n assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);\n vec.shrink_to_fit();\n assert!(vec.capacity() >= 3);\n ```\n"
