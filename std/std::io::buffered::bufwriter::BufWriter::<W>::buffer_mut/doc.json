  "doc": " Returns a mutable reference to the internal buffer.\n\n This can be used to write data directly into the buffer without triggering writers\n to the underlying writer.\n\n That the buffer is a `Vec` is an implementation detail.\n Callers should not modify the capacity as there currently is no public API to do so\n and thus any capacity changes would be unexpected by the user.\n"
