  "doc": " Changes the timestamps of the underlying file.\n\n # Platform-specific behavior\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `futimens` function on Unix (falling back to\n `futimes` on macOS before 10.13) and the `SetFileTime` function on Windows. Note that this\n [may change in the future][changes].\n\n On most platforms, including UNIX and Windows platforms, this function can also change the\n timestamps of a directory. To get a `File` representing a directory in order to call\n `set_times`, open the directory with `File::open` without attempting to obtain write\n permission.\n\n [changes]: io#platform-specific-behavior\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error if the user lacks permission to change timestamps on the\n underlying file. It may also return an error in other os-specific unspecified cases.\n\n This function may return an error if the operating system lacks support to change one or\n more of the timestamps set in the `FileTimes` structure.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     use std::fs::{self, File, FileTimes};\n\n     let src = fs::metadata(\"src\")?;\n     let dest = File::open(\"dest\")?;\n     let times = FileTimes::new()\n         .set_accessed(src.accessed()?)\n         .set_modified(src.modified()?);\n     dest.set_times(times)?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
