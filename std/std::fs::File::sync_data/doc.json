  "doc": " This function is similar to [`sync_all`], except that it might not\n synchronize file metadata to the filesystem.\n\n This is intended for use cases that must synchronize content, but don't\n need the metadata on disk. The goal of this method is to reduce disk\n operations.\n\n Note that some platforms may simply implement this in terms of\n [`sync_all`].\n\n [`sync_all`]: File::sync_all\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs::File;\n use std::io::prelude::*;\n\n fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n     let mut f = File::create(\"foo.txt\")?;\n     f.write_all(b\"Hello, world!\")?;\n\n     f.sync_data()?;\n     Ok(())\n }\n ```\n"
