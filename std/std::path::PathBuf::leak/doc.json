  "doc": " Consumes and leaks the `PathBuf`, returning a mutable reference to the contents,\n `&'a mut Path`.\n\n The caller has free choice over the returned lifetime, including 'static.\n Indeed, this function is ideally used for data that lives for the remainder of\n the program's life, as dropping the returned reference will cause a memory leak.\n\n It does not reallocate or shrink the `PathBuf`, so the leaked allocation may include\n unused capacity that is not part of the returned slice. If you want to discard excess\n capacity, call [`into_boxed_path`], and then [`Box::leak`] instead.\n However, keep in mind that trimming the capacity may result in a reallocation and copy.\n\n [`into_boxed_path`]: Self::into_boxed_path\n"
