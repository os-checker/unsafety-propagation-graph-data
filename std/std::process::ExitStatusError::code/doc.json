  "doc": " Reports the exit code, if applicable, from an `ExitStatusError`.\n\n In Unix terms the return value is the **exit status**: the value passed to `exit`, if the\n process finished by calling `exit`.  Note that on Unix the exit status is truncated to 8\n bits, and that values that didn't come from a program's call to `exit` may be invented by the\n runtime system (often, for example, 255, 254, 127 or 126).\n\n On Unix, this will return `None` if the process was terminated by a signal.  If you want to\n handle such situations specially, consider using methods from\n [`ExitStatusExt`](crate::os::unix::process::ExitStatusExt).\n\n If the process finished by calling `exit` with a nonzero value, this will return\n that exit status.\n\n If the error was something else, it will return `None`.\n\n If the process exited successfully (ie, by calling `exit(0)`), there is no\n `ExitStatusError`.  So the return value from `ExitStatusError::code()` is always nonzero.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(exit_status_error)]\n # #[cfg(all(unix, not(target_os = \"android\"), not(all(target_vendor = \"apple\", not(target_os = \"macos\")))))] {\n use std::process::Command;\n\n let bad = Command::new(\"false\").status().unwrap().exit_ok().unwrap_err();\n assert_eq!(bad.code(), Some(1));\n # } // #[cfg(unix)]\n ```\n"
