  "doc": " Sets the value of the `TCP_NODELAY` option on this socket.\n\n If set, this option disables the Nagle algorithm. This means that\n segments are always sent as soon as possible, even if there is only a\n small amount of data. When not set, data is buffered until there is a\n sufficient amount to send out, thereby avoiding the frequent sending of\n small packets.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::net::TcpStream;\n\n let stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")\n                        .expect(\"Couldn't connect to the server...\");\n stream.set_nodelay(true).expect(\"set_nodelay call failed\");\n ```\n"
