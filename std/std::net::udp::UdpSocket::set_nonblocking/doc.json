  "doc": " Moves this UDP socket into or out of nonblocking mode.\n\n This will result in `recv`, `recv_from`, `send`, and `send_to` system\n operations becoming nonblocking, i.e., immediately returning from their\n calls. If the IO operation is successful, `Ok` is returned and no\n further action is required. If the IO operation could not be completed\n and needs to be retried, an error with kind\n [`io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`] is returned.\n\n On Unix platforms, calling this method corresponds to calling `fcntl`\n `FIONBIO`. On Windows calling this method corresponds to calling\n `ioctlsocket` `FIONBIO`.\n\n # Examples\n\n Creates a UDP socket bound to `127.0.0.1:7878` and read bytes in\n nonblocking mode:\n\n ```no_run\n use std::io;\n use std::net::UdpSocket;\n\n let socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:7878\").unwrap();\n socket.set_nonblocking(true).unwrap();\n\n # fn wait_for_fd() { unimplemented!() }\n let mut buf = [0; 10];\n let (num_bytes_read, _) = loop {\n     match socket.recv_from(&mut buf) {\n         Ok(n) => break n,\n         Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock => {\n             // wait until network socket is ready, typically implemented\n             // via platform-specific APIs such as epoll or IOCP\n             wait_for_fd();\n         }\n         Err(e) => panic!(\"encountered IO error: {e}\"),\n     }\n };\n println!(\"bytes: {:?}\", &buf[..num_bytes_read]);\n ```\n"
