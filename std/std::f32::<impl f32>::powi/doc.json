  "doc": " Raises a number to an integer power.\n\n Using this function is generally faster than using `powf`.\n It might have a different sequence of rounding operations than `powf`,\n so the results are not guaranteed to agree.\n\n Note that this function is special in that it can return non-NaN results for NaN inputs. For\n example, `f32::powi(f32::NAN, 0)` returns `1.0`. However, if an input is a *signaling*\n NaN, then the result is non-deterministically either a NaN or the result that the\n corresponding quiet NaN would produce.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = 2.0_f32;\n let abs_difference = (x.powi(2) - (x * x)).abs();\n assert!(abs_difference <= 1e-5);\n\n assert_eq!(f32::powi(f32::NAN, 0), 1.0);\n assert_eq!(f32::powi(0.0, 0), 1.0);\n ```\n"
