  "doc": " Returns `e^(self) - 1` in a way that is accurate even if the\n number is close to zero.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and\n can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n This function currently corresponds to the `expm1f` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n let x = 1e-8_f32;\n\n // for very small x, e^x is approximately 1 + x + x^2 / 2\n let approx = x + x * x / 2.0;\n let abs_difference = (x.exp_m1() - approx).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference < 1e-10);\n ```\n"
