  "doc": " Gamma function.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `tgammaf` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f16)]\n #![feature(float_gamma)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f16_math)] {\n\n let x = 5.0f16;\n\n let abs_difference = (x.gamma() - 24.0).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f16::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
