  "doc": " Gets the contents of the cell, initializing it to `f()` if the cell\n was uninitialized.\n\n Many threads may call `get_or_init` concurrently with different\n initializing functions, but it is guaranteed that only one function\n will be executed if the function doesn't panic.\n\n # Panics\n\n If `f()` panics, the panic is propagated to the caller, and the cell\n remains uninitialized.\n\n It is an error to reentrantly initialize the cell from `f`. The\n exact outcome is unspecified. Current implementation deadlocks, but\n this may be changed to a panic in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n let cell = OnceLock::new();\n let value = cell.get_or_init(|| 92);\n assert_eq!(value, &92);\n let value = cell.get_or_init(|| unreachable!());\n assert_eq!(value, &92);\n ```\n"
