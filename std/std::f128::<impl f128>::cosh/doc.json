  "doc": " Hyperbolic cosine function.\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `coshf128` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f128_math)] {\n\n let e = std::f128::consts::E;\n let x = 1.0f128;\n let f = x.cosh();\n // Solving cosh() at 1 gives this result\n let g = ((e * e) + 1.0) / (2.0 * e);\n let abs_difference = (f - g).abs();\n\n // Same result\n assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
