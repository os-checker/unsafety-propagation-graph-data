  "doc": " Returns the `n`th element of the iterator.\n\n Like most indexing operations, the count starts from zero, so `nth(0)`\n returns the first value, `nth(1)` the second, and so on.\n\n Note that all preceding elements, as well as the returned element, will be\n consumed from the iterator. That means that the preceding elements will be\n discarded, and also that calling `nth(0)` multiple times on the same iterator\n will return different elements.\n\n `nth()` will return [`None`] if `n` is greater than or equal to the length of the\n iterator.\n\n # Examples\n\n Basic usage:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n assert_eq!(a.into_iter().nth(1), Some(2));\n ```\n\n Calling `nth()` multiple times doesn't rewind the iterator:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n let mut iter = a.into_iter();\n\n assert_eq!(iter.nth(1), Some(2));\n assert_eq!(iter.nth(1), None);\n ```\n\n Returning `None` if there are less than `n + 1` elements:\n\n ```\n let a = [1, 2, 3];\n assert_eq!(a.into_iter().nth(10), None);\n ```\n"
