  "doc": " Attempts to return a pending value on this receiver without blocking.\n\n This method will never block the caller in order to wait for data to\n become available. Instead, this will always return immediately with a\n possible option of pending data on the channel.\n\n This is useful for a flavor of \"optimistic check\" before deciding to\n block on a receiver.\n\n Compared with [`recv`], this function has two failure cases instead of one\n (one for disconnection, one for an empty buffer).\n\n [`recv`]: Self::recv\n\n # Examples\n\n ```rust\n use std::sync::mpsc::{Receiver, channel};\n\n let (_, receiver): (_, Receiver<i32>) = channel();\n\n assert!(receiver.try_recv().is_err());\n ```\n"
