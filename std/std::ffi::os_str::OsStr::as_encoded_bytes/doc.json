  "doc": " Converts an OS string slice to a byte slice.  To convert the byte slice back into an OS\n string slice, use the [`OsStr::from_encoded_bytes_unchecked`] function.\n\n The byte encoding is an unspecified, platform-specific, self-synchronizing superset of UTF-8.\n By being a self-synchronizing superset of UTF-8, this encoding is also a superset of 7-bit\n ASCII.\n\n Note: As the encoding is unspecified, any sub-slice of bytes that is not valid UTF-8 should\n be treated as opaque and only comparable within the same Rust version built for the same\n target platform.  For example, sending the slice over the network or storing it in a file\n will likely result in incompatible byte slices.  See [`OsString`] for more encoding details\n and [`std::ffi`] for platform-specific, specified conversions.\n\n [`std::ffi`]: crate::ffi\n"
