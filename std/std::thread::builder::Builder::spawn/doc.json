The join handle can be used to block on\n termination of the spawned thread, including recovering its panics.\n\n For a more complete documentation see [`thread::spawn`].\n\n # Errors\n\n Unlike the [`spawn`] free function, this method yields an\n [`io::Result`] to capture any failure to create the thread at\n the OS level.\n\n [`io::Result`]: crate::io::Result\n\n # Panics\n\n Panics if a thread name was set and it contained null bytes.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::thread;\n\n let builder = thread::Builder::new();\n\n let handler = builder.spawn(|| {\n     // thread code\n }).unwrap();\n\n handler.join().unwrap();\n ```\n\n [`thread::spawn`]: super::spawn\n [`spawn`]: super::spawn\n"
