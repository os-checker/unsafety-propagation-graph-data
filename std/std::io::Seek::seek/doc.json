  "doc": " Seek to an offset, in bytes, in a stream.\n\n A seek beyond the end of a stream is allowed, but behavior is defined\n by the implementation.\n\n If the seek operation completed successfully,\n this method returns the new position from the start of the stream.\n That position can be used later with [`SeekFrom::Start`].\n\n # Errors\n\n Seeking can fail, for example because it might involve flushing a buffer.\n\n Seeking to a negative offset is considered an error.\n"
