  "doc": " Makes a [`MappedRwLockReadGuard`] for a component of the borrowed data.\n The original guard is returned as an `Err(...)` if the closure returns\n `None`.\n\n The `RwLock` is already locked for reading, so this cannot fail.\n\n This is an associated function that needs to be used as\n `MappedRwLockReadGuard::filter_map(...)`. A method would interfere with\n methods of the same name on the contents of the `MappedRwLockReadGuard`\n used through `Deref`.\n\n # Panics\n\n If the closure panics, the guard will be dropped (unlocked).\n"
