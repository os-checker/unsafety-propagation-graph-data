  "doc": " Gets the mutable reference of the contents of the cell, initializing\n it to `f()` if the cell was uninitialized.\n\n This method never blocks. Since it borrows the `OnceLock` mutably,\n it is statically guaranteed that no active borrows to the `OnceLock`\n exist, including from other threads.\n\n # Panics\n\n If `f()` panics, the panic is propagated to the caller, and the cell\n remains uninitialized.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(once_cell_get_mut)]\n\n use std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n let mut cell = OnceLock::new();\n let value = cell.get_mut_or_init(|| 92);\n assert_eq!(*value, 92);\n\n *value += 2;\n assert_eq!(*value, 94);\n\n let value = cell.get_mut_or_init(|| unreachable!());\n assert_eq!(*value, 94);\n ```\n"
