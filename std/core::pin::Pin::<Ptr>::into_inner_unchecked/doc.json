  "doc": " Unwraps this `Pin<Ptr>`, returning the underlying `Ptr`.\n\n # Safety\n\n This function is unsafe. You must guarantee that you will continue to\n treat the pointer `Ptr` as pinned after you call this function, so that\n the invariants on the `Pin` type can be upheld. If the code using the\n resulting `Ptr` does not continue to maintain the pinning invariants that\n is a violation of the API contract and may lead to undefined behavior in\n later (safe) operations.\n\n Note that you must be able to guarantee that the data pointed to by `Ptr`\n will be treated as pinned all the way until its `drop` handler is complete!\n\n *For more information, see the [`pin` module docs][self]*\n\n If the underlying data is [`Unpin`], [`Pin::into_inner`] should be used\n instead.\n"
