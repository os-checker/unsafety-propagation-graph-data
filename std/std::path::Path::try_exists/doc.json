  "doc": " Returns `Ok(true)` if the path points at an existing entity.\n\n This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the\n destination file. In case of broken symbolic links this will return `Ok(false)`.\n\n [`Path::exists()`] only checks whether or not a path was both found and readable. By\n contrast, `try_exists` will return `Ok(true)` or `Ok(false)`, respectively, if the path\n was _verified_ to exist or not exist. If its existence can neither be confirmed nor\n denied, it will propagate an `Err(_)` instead. This can be the case if e.g. listing\n permission is denied on one of the parent directories.\n\n Note that while this avoids some pitfalls of the `exists()` method, it still can not\n prevent time-of-check to time-of-use ([TOCTOU]) bugs. You should only use it in scenarios\n where those bugs are not an issue.\n\n This is an alias for [`std::fs::exists`](crate::fs::exists).\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::path::Path;\n assert!(!Path::new(\"does_not_exist.txt\").try_exists().expect(\"Can't check existence of file does_not_exist.txt\"));\n assert!(Path::new(\"/root/secret_file.txt\").try_exists().is_err());\n ```\n\n [TOCTOU]: fs#time-of-check-to-time-of-use-toctou\n [`exists()`]: Self::exists\n"
