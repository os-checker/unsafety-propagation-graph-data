  "doc": " Elementwise fused multiply-add. Computes `(self * a) + b` with only one rounding error,\n yielding a more accurate result than an unfused multiply-add.\n\n Using `mul_add` *may* be more performant than an unfused multiply-add if the target\n architecture has a dedicated `fma` CPU instruction.  However, this is not always\n true, and will be heavily dependent on designing algorithms with specific target\n hardware in mind.\n"
