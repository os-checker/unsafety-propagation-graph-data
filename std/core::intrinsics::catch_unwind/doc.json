  "doc": " Rust's \"try catch\" construct for unwinding. Invokes the function pointer `try_fn` with the\n data pointer `data`, and calls `catch_fn` if unwinding occurs while `try_fn` runs.\n Returns `1` if unwinding occurred and `catch_fn` was called; returns `0` otherwise.\n\n `catch_fn` must not unwind.\n\n The third argument is a function called if an unwind occurs (both Rust `panic` and foreign\n unwinds). This function takes the data pointer and a pointer to the target- and\n runtime-specific exception object that was caught.\n\n Note that in the case of a foreign unwinding operation, the exception object data may not be\n safely usable from Rust, and should not be directly exposed via the standard library. To\n prevent unsafe access, the library implementation may either abort the process or present an\n opaque error type to the user.\n\n For more information, see the compiler's source, as well as the documentation for the stable\n version of this intrinsic, `std::panic::catch_unwind`.\n"
