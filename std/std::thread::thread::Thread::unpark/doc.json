  "doc": " Atomically makes the handle's token available if it is not already.\n\n Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via\n the [`park`] function and the `unpark()` method. These can be used as a\n more CPU-efficient implementation of a spinlock.\n\n See the [park documentation] for more details.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::thread;\n use std::time::Duration;\n use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\n static QUEUED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);\n\n let parked_thread = thread::Builder::new()\n     .spawn(|| {\n         println!(\"Parking thread\");\n         QUEUED.store(true, Ordering::Release);\n         thread::park();\n         println!(\"Thread unparked\");\n     })\n     .unwrap();\n\n // Let some time pass for the thread to be spawned.\n thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));\n\n // Wait until the other thread is queued.\n // This is crucial! It guarantees that the `unpark` below is not consumed\n // by some other code in the parked thread (e.g. inside `println!`).\n while !QUEUED.load(Ordering::Acquire) {\n     // Spinning is of course inefficient; in practice, this would more likely be\n     // a dequeue where we have no work to do if there's nobody queued.\n     std::hint::spin_loop();\n }\n\n println!(\"Unpark the thread\");\n parked_thread.thread().unpark();\n\n parked_thread.join().unwrap();\n ```\n\n [`park`]: super::park\n [park documentation]: super::park\n"
