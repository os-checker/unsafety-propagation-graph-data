  "doc": " Creates an empty `HashMap` which will use the given hash builder to hash\n keys.\n\n The created map has the default initial capacity.\n\n Warning: `hash_builder` is normally randomly generated, and\n is designed to allow HashMaps to be resistant to attacks that\n cause many collisions and very poor performance. Setting it\n manually using this function can expose a DoS attack vector.\n\n The `hash_builder` passed should implement the [`BuildHasher`] trait for\n the `HashMap` to be useful, see its documentation for details.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::collections::HashMap;\n use std::hash::RandomState;\n\n let s = RandomState::new();\n let mut map = HashMap::with_hasher(s);\n map.insert(1, 2);\n ```\n"
