  "doc": " Gets the mutable reference of the contents of the cell, initializing\n it to `f()` if the cell was uninitialized. If the cell was uninitialized\n and `f()` failed, an error is returned.\n\n This method never blocks. Since it borrows the `OnceLock` mutably,\n it is statically guaranteed that no active borrows to the `OnceLock`\n exist, including from other threads.\n\n # Panics\n\n If `f()` panics, the panic is propagated to the caller, and\n the cell remains uninitialized.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(once_cell_get_mut)]\n\n use std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n let mut cell: OnceLock<u32> = OnceLock::new();\n\n // Failed attempts to initialize the cell do not change its contents\n assert!(cell.get_mut_or_try_init(|| \"not a number!\".parse()).is_err());\n assert!(cell.get().is_none());\n\n let value = cell.get_mut_or_try_init(|| \"1234\".parse());\n assert_eq!(value, Ok(&mut 1234));\n *value.unwrap() += 2;\n assert_eq!(cell.get(), Some(&1236))\n ```\n"
