  "doc": " Captures a stack backtrace of the current thread.\n\n This function will capture a stack backtrace of the current OS thread of\n execution, returning a `Backtrace` type which can be later used to print\n the entire stack trace or render it to a string.\n\n This function will be a noop if the `RUST_BACKTRACE` or\n `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE` backtrace variables are both not set. If either\n environment variable is set and enabled then this function will actually\n capture a backtrace. Capturing a backtrace can be both memory intensive\n and slow, so these environment variables allow liberally using\n `Backtrace::capture` and only incurring a slowdown when the environment\n variables are set.\n\n To forcibly capture a backtrace regardless of environment variables, use\n the `Backtrace::force_capture` function.\n"
