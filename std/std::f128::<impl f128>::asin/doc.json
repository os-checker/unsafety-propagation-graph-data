  "span": "$library/std/src/num/f128.rs:489:5: 489:30",
  "doc": " Computes the arcsine of a number. Return value is in radians in\n the range [-pi/2, pi/2] or NaN if the number is outside the range\n [-1, 1].\n\n # Unspecified precision\n\n The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform,\n Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.\n\n This function currently corresponds to the `asinf128` from libc on Unix\n and Windows. Note that this might change in the future.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(f128)]\n # #[cfg(not(miri))]\n # #[cfg(target_has_reliable_f128_math)] {\n\n let f = std::f128::consts::FRAC_PI_4;\n\n // asin(sin(pi/2))\n let abs_difference = (f.sin().asin() - f).abs();\n\n assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);\n # }\n ```\n"
