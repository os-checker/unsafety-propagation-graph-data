  "doc": " Resizing `write_all` implementation for [`Cursor`].\n\n Cursor is allowed to have a pre-allocated and initialised\n vector body, but with a position of 0. This means the [`Write`]\n will overwrite the contents of the vec.\n\n This also allows for the vec body to be empty, but with a position of N.\n This means that [`Write`] will pad the vec with 0 initially,\n before writing anything from that point\n"
