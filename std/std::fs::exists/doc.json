  "doc": " Returns `Ok(true)` if the path points at an existing entity.\n\n This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the\n destination file. In case of broken symbolic links this will return `Ok(false)`.\n\n As opposed to the [`Path::exists`] method, this will only return `Ok(true)` or `Ok(false)`\n if the path was _verified_ to exist or not exist. If its existence can neither be confirmed\n nor denied, an `Err(_)` will be propagated instead. This can be the case if e.g. listing\n permission is denied on one of the parent directories.\n\n Note that while this avoids some pitfalls of the `exists()` method, it still can not\n prevent time-of-check to time-of-use ([TOCTOU]) bugs. You should only use it in scenarios\n where those bugs are not an issue.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```no_run\n use std::fs;\n\n assert!(!fs::exists(\"does_not_exist.txt\").expect(\"Can't check existence of file does_not_exist.txt\"));\n assert!(fs::exists(\"/root/secret_file.txt\").is_err());\n ```\n\n [`Path::exists`]: crate::path::Path::exists\n [TOCTOU]: self#time-of-check-to-time-of-use-toctou\n"
