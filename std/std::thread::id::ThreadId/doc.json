  "doc": " A unique identifier for a running thread.\n\n A `ThreadId` is an opaque object that uniquely identifies each thread\n created during the lifetime of a process. `ThreadId`s are guaranteed not to\n be reused, even when a thread terminates. `ThreadId`s are under the control\n of Rust's standard library and there may not be any relationship between\n `ThreadId` and the underlying platform's notion of a thread identifier --\n the two concepts cannot, therefore, be used interchangeably. A `ThreadId`\n can be retrieved from the [`id`] method on a [`Thread`].\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::thread;\n\n let other_thread = thread::spawn(|| {\n     thread::current().id()\n });\n\n let other_thread_id = other_thread.join().unwrap();\n assert!(thread::current().id() != other_thread_id);\n ```\n\n [`Thread`]: super::Thread\n [`id`]: super::Thread::id\n"
