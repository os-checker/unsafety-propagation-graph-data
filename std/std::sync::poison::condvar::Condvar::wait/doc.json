  "doc": " Blocks the current thread until this condition variable receives a\n notification.\n\n This function will atomically unlock the mutex specified (represented by\n `guard`) and block the current thread. This means that any calls\n to [`notify_one`] or [`notify_all`] which happen logically after the\n mutex is unlocked are candidates to wake this thread up. When this\n function call returns, the lock specified will have been re-acquired.\n\n Note that this function is susceptible to spurious wakeups. Condition\n variables normally have a boolean predicate associated with them, and\n the predicate must always be checked each time this function returns to\n protect against spurious wakeups.\n\n # Errors\n\n This function will return an error if the mutex being waited on is\n poisoned when this thread re-acquires the lock. For more information,\n see information about [poisoning] on the [`Mutex`] type.\n\n # Panics\n\n This function may [`panic!`] if it is used with more than one mutex\n over time.\n\n [`notify_one`]: Self::notify_one\n [`notify_all`]: Self::notify_all\n [poisoning]: super::Mutex#poisoning\n [`Mutex`]: super::Mutex\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, Condvar};\n use std::thread;\n\n let pair = Arc::new((Mutex::new(false), Condvar::new()));\n let pair2 = Arc::clone(&pair);\n\n thread::spawn(move || {\n     let (lock, cvar) = &*pair2;\n     let mut started = lock.lock().unwrap();\n     *started = true;\n     // We notify the condvar that the value has changed.\n     cvar.notify_one();\n });\n\n // Wait for the thread to start up.\n let (lock, cvar) = &*pair;\n let mut started = lock.lock().unwrap();\n // As long as the value inside the `Mutex<bool>` is `false`, we wait.\n while !*started {\n     started = cvar.wait(started).unwrap();\n }\n ```\n"
