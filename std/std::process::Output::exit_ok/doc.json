  "doc": " Returns an error if a nonzero exit status was received.\n\n If the [`Command`] exited successfully,\n `self` is returned.\n\n This is equivalent to calling [`exit_ok`](ExitStatus::exit_ok)\n on [`Output.status`](Output::status).\n\n Note that this will throw away the [`Output::stderr`] field in the error case.\n If the child process outputs useful informantion to stderr, you can:\n * Use `cmd.stderr(Stdio::inherit())` to forward the\n   stderr child process to the parent's stderr,\n   usually printing it to console where the user can see it.\n   This is usually correct for command-line applications.\n * Capture `stderr` using a custom error type.\n   This is usually correct for libraries.\n\n # Examples\n\n ```\n #![feature(exit_status_error)]\n # #[cfg(all(unix, not(target_os = \"android\"), not(all(target_vendor = \"apple\", not(target_os = \"macos\")))))] {\n use std::process::Command;\n assert!(Command::new(\"false\").output().unwrap().exit_ok().is_err());\n # }\n ```\n"
